  An Algebraic Approach to Koopman Classical Mechanics
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00526

  Classical mechanics is presented here in a unary operator form, constructed using the binary multiplication and Poisson bracket operations that are given in a phase space formalism, then a Gibbs equilibrium state over this unary operator algebra is introduced, which allows the construction of a Hilbert space as a representation space of a Heisenberg algebra, giving a noncommutative operator algebraic variant of the Koopman-von Neumann approach.
