Notes: 

swap-lofi.c
   Simple numerical integration of S_12 done in double precision
   as a genneral sanity check.

exact-series.c
    seems to be an "exact" evaluation of 
       Integral of (x^(s-1))/(x+alpha) dx
   obtained by a binomial expansion of 1/(x+alpha) and then
   summing the series.
   The above is used to get "exact" piece-wise pieces for

       Integral of (x^(s-1)) S_12(x) dx

   that are then piece-wise summed.  Where S_12 is the 12 swapped
   continued fraction.

exact-bignum.c: as as above, but bignum

netwon-series.c
    newtown-series ... not quite sure ... S_12 ...regulated ??
