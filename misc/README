calkin-wilf: Sept 2015
   -- a recursive function that gives the denominator of the
      Stern-Brocot tree. Graphing it, its reminiscent of Mink
      measure.

graph:
   -- schroedinger eqn on a 1D lattice

geodesic:
   -- explores the symbol dynamics of the SL(2,Z) fundamental domain.


measure: Sept 2015
   -- (exact) approximation and bound for the measure, inclusing scaling of
      the thing.

norlund-rice:
	-- grpahs plot of riemann zeta, and numeric show of one of
	   Baez-Duarte's Riemann sums. Minor stuff

plouffe:
  -- checks a series of Riemann zeta identities for some of 
     Plouffe's sums 

schroedinger:
   -- solving misc 1-d schroedinger equations.

ffbasis: Dec 2014
   -- falling factorial basis for divisor/multiplicative functions
