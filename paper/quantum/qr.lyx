\begin_layout Abstract
A variety of speculations about the nature of quantum mechanics and wave-functio
n collapse.
 A number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

key principles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are set down; these must surely hold true.
 Holding onto these, a variety of mathematical effects are explored, to
 see if or how they might be appropriate for describing QM, and its relationship
 to space and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Although this appeals to a variety of mathematical ideas, this is an attempt
 to do physics, i.e.
 to argue with words, instead of writing down formulas.
 No formulas, just some postulates of things that seem like they are true
 or should be true.
 Fairly random and disorganized thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Many of these here are bad ideas, wrong somehow.
 The ideas near the end are probably much better than the ideas at the beginning
, since they are sharper, more pointed.
 Its edited in a hap-hazard way; I change my mind as I go along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Intro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravitation.
 Its primarily a discussion of principles that seem like they should guide
 such a unification.
 This means few or no equations.
 Some of these principles may be controversial, and surely some readers
 will think they're (not even) wrong.
 They might be, but its the groundwork for my thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also begins by (almost) completely ignoring the work of others on quantum
 gravity and strings and Penrose and ER=EPR and AdS/CFT and Schrieber's
 SuperPoint and so-on.
 I want to state what seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first principles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whereas these existing theories have already made many explicit or implicit
 assumptions about first principles that are (possibly?) in contradiction
 with what I'm pondering.
 This does not mean that I reject these theories; I partially understand
 many of them, and kind-of like them (they are interesting, fun, elegant,
 and worth getting lost in).
 But rather, if we start with them, then we are forced into arcana almost
 immediately.
 I want to start with a clean slate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Argument from authority: I have a PhD in theoretical particle physics, and
 have studied gravitation (Riemannian geometry), affine Lie algebras (string
 theory), and also the various places where these things take you: algebraic
 topology, category theory, sheaves and many other topics in math.
 This is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appeal to authority
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (argumentum ad verecundiam) - more accurately, a request to the reader
 to not immediately dismiss this text as quackery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: this is trying to be an informed discussion about mathematics
 that does not use formulas.
 At times, this might make it sound simplistic.
 I am trying to write in the most simplistic way that I can do so.
 This is intentional.
 Do not be fooled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Statement of Principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We take these to be self-evident facts.
 Or something thereabouts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Quantum post facto
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of quantum mechanics should come out of the unification of QM
 and gravity, rather than being one of the ingredients going into it.
 In particular, the Feynman functional integral should be something that
 comes out of the theory, as an unavoidable result, rather than going into
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Quantum is primarily microscopic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a rejection of the Schroedinger-Cat paradox.
 I'm not sure, it may be equivalent to a rejection of Many-Worlds.
 Its a statement about wave-function collapse.
 The idea is that any quantum effect (e.g.
 quantum measurement) that causes sufficiently large perturbations in its
 surroundings causes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave-function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The cut-off point seems to be the Planck mass.
 That is, when the decaying nucleus that kills the cat fires off, it is
 in a superposition, but only to the point that about one Planck-mass of
 detector atoms are involved.
 After that, alternative histories either converge or spontaneously evaporate.
 So, for example, although there are and continue to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the quantum scale, once some of these interact with the macroscopic
 scale, the probabilities of the alternative worlds shrink exponentially
 to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument is that gravitation is too weak to have any significant effect
 on the microscopic scale, and the fact that an electron might be in many
 places at once has vanishing gravitational effect, up to the point that
 the electron has disturbed about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 atoms, at which point, gravitational effects can no longer be ignored.
 That is, gravitation remains classical, and there is a single unique space-time
 geometry at the macroscopic scale.
 Put another way: if Schrödinger cat is alive, space-time curves one way,
 and if the cat is dead, then space-time curves another way.
 There is no superposition of different space-time curvatures.
 There are not many-worlds of parallel space-times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an idea brazenly stolen from Roger Penrose, who surely states it
 in some more eloquent fashion than I can muster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supporting argument: See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Macroscopic states have no phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Objection: Bose-Einstein states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If wave-function collapse occurs at the 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 atom scale, then how does one explain superfluidity, which involves more
 than that many atoms? Conditional answer: because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 involves only fermions...
 See comments about spinc group, below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Speculation: Entanglement has something to do with the spin group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spin group (see below) is constructed from the unit-length of a Clifford
 algebra, and naturally factorizes into Weyl spinors and anti-spinors (which,
 by the way, anti-commute correctly).
 A single point on the spin group seems to describe 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 fermions, and a change of basis implies that these fermions are entangled.
 Note that these spinors are described without any reference whatsoever
 to any ambient space-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is perhaps an absurd and premature speculation, since one can get wave-func
tion entanglement simply by considering any complex projective space; the
 spin group is not at all required for this.
 Later on, some support for this speculation is provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Speculation: Wave-function collapse is like spontaneous symmetry breaking!
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard formulation of relativistic quantum field theory formulated
 on flat Minkowski space connects up several distinct things: First, the
 spin group is constructed, and the various half-spin and spin representations
 are noted.
 Next, a frame bundle is build, not just any frame bundle, but a spin structure.
 This is used to build a spin manifold.
 These are fancy words, given that the background is flat Minkowski space
 – but it gets the point across.
 Next, the observation is made that the whole construction is invariant
 under the Poincaré algebra.
 This allows an identification of spin representations as the same thing
 as the angular momentum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Textbooks always handle Poincaré invariance on the tangent spaces of these
 bundles.
 There is an interesting paper by Ohanian (see later, below) that performs
 the same identification, but on the bundle itself, rather than on the tangent
 space.
 Which is an interesting confirmation that we've correctly integrated on
 the tangent space (i.e.
 that we've correctly taken the Lie derivatives into the corresponding exp
 maps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observation is that, at the Planck-mass scale, and larger, the assumption
 of global Poincaré invariance fails.
 This can trigger collapse in two ways: one way is that its is not energetically
 favorable to have multiple trajectories, multiple histories any more; the
 other way is that the integrability conditions on the spinor bundle get
 screwed up in some way.
 That is, the tangent vector (spinor) fields are no longer integrable, or
 that the integral curves converge into one.
 Perhaps some topological obstruction – some Stiefel-Whitney type cohomology
 cycle pops up.
 Perhaps its both...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Speculation: Wave-function collapse is like QCD confinement! 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "par:Collapse-is-confinement"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speculation here is that wave-function collapse, driven by gravitation,
 is essentially driven by the same mechanism as QCD confinement, except
 that the characteristic scale is completely different: systems with more
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 atoms break up into domains where classical physics dominates, whereas
 smaller systems can have QM superposition effects run freely inside of
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument here is that QCD confinement occurs for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 Yang-Mills theory for which the structure group is more complicated than
 U(1).
 This certainly should then apply to a spin-2 gauge particle (graviton)
 with a Yang-Mills type self-coupling in the field-strength term in the
 action, viz.
 with structure group SO(3,1) or Spin(4).
 However, since gravitation is so weak, the scale of the confined region
 is much much larger, in proportion to the inverse of the coupling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We seem to kill two birds with one stone: this provides both the mechanism
 of the collapse, and also to characteristic scale for it.
 Gravitation provides a scale factor of the appropriate size, confinement
 provides the mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that QCD confinement remains a Millennium-prize problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Speculation: Entanglement is like superconductivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, that the entangled state of two qubits is like the entangled
 state of BCS pairs.
 Long-range order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is not one, but two plausibility arguments for this.
 First, we know from RHIC experiments that the QCD plasma behaves like a
 superfluid.
 By analogy, if wave-function collapse is like QCD confinement, then the
 entangled-state needs to be superfluid-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second plausibility argument is the recent work on treating the surface
 of black holes as a superfluid; this was in pop press, need to track down
 the reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the order parameter? The phenomenology of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Pheonom:-Two-state-vector-formalism"

\end_inset

 two-state vector formalism suggests that the order parameter is some ratio
 of qubits to classical bits.
 See, for example, SIC-POVM (symmetric, informationally complete, positive
 operator valued measure).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Practical: Entanglement is conserved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Entanglement is in some sense quasi-conserved, up to the point where its
 broken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entanglement current
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? i.e.
 what if entanglement is like a conserved charge, is there a corresponding
 current, where the entanglement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leaked away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 during a measurement? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there an index-theorem for entanglement? Some generalized Atiyah-Singer-ish
 thingy? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See above, paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Collapse-is-confinement"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Collapse is Confinement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: Entanglement is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conserved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 just like superconductivity is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conserved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inside of the region of space where the temperature is low enough.
 In this case, entanglement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flows freely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in regions of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{18}$
\end_inset

 or fewer atoms, and is broken for larger regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analogy suggests that, just like superfluids are a mixture of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

superfluid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 states, then perhaps quantum states can be mixtures of classical and quantum
 states.
 Entanglement is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

superfluid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Principle: Space-time is emergent 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "par:Space-time-is-emergent"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is kind of a reversal of Verlinde's ideas.
 The concept of Lorentz invariance isn't possible, until one is working
 at a scale where space-time exists.
 The core issue here is that all of our clocks and rulers are microscopic
 and quantum mechanical: we measure time by vibrations of some quantum device.
 We measure space by counting wavelengths.
 The redefinition of mass (via Planck's constant) in the SI system makes
 it quantum based.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Speculation: Relativity requires that space-time is a sheaf 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematicians already know that space-time is a sheaf; no surprise
 there.
 The speculation here is that the gluing axioms of a sheaf are exactly where
 the quantum effects live.
 So: the issue here is what do do about special relativity with respect
 to quantum mechanics.
 If we envision that the present is like an advancing wave-front, where
 everything in the past is frozen and fixed, while everything in the future
 is unknown and fluid, then the present is like a wave of freezing or of
 crystallization sweeping through space-time.
 The problem is that such a surface is manifestly not covariant; one cannot
 time-order points outside the light-cone.
 The solution to this seems to be to treat space-time as a sheaf, but to
 allow the gluing axioms of a sheaf (that convert a pre-sheaf into a sheaf)
 – allow those gluing axioms to only hold within the past-lightcone.
 That is, the past becomes frozen precisely because this is where the sections
 of a pre-sheaf are finally glued together into an actual sheaf, and become
 correlated and firm.
 Quantum mechanics exists exactly where things are not yet glued together.
 Quantum measurement is (very roughly, misleadingly) the act of gluing.
 More precisely, space-like separated measurements of entangled states (Bell
 states, etc.) are in a fluid state until the results of those measurements
 are brought back to a common location, thus placing both measurements in
 a common past-lightcone.
 It is here where the many-worlds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sections
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 get glued together in such a way that there are no violations of QM.
 Thus, in a sense, QM in space-like separated regions behaves like a pre-sheaf;
 the sections of the presheaf glue together along the edges of past light-cones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put this more precisely: the different histories from a many-worlds scenario
 encounter one-another on the surface of a light cone.
 It is there that the histories sort themselves out, kind-of-like the gluing
 of the gluing axioms joining different sections together.
 The actual gluing is actually dynamic, given by amplitudes - e.g.
 zero amplitude means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can't glue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - so in normal physics textbooks, you never see sheaves or gluing, you
 just see amplitudes and propagators.
 But those amplitudes are just stating what can be glued to what, and what
 cannot be.
 Insofar are propagators are light-like, that's where the gluing actually
 happens.
 They hyopthesis is that by the time you get to the planck mass (per Penrose),
 the requirement of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

consistent histories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that most pre-sheaf sections have been glued together in a consistent
 way, and the number of possible 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

many worlds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has decreased in number: the only ones left are the one that have consistent
 histories in the past light-cone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many world are there in the MW interpretation? If the above hypothesis
 holds, then the naive answer would be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one per point in a space-like surface
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Unlike the Everrett hypothesis, here, the number of possible worlds is
 not increasing at some exponential rate, but is holding steady (at some
 small uncountable cardinal, presumably at the cardinal of the continuum).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, there is one world of many-worlds per 3-D plank volume.
 By poincare duality, there is one world per planck mass.
 The total number of worlds in many-worlds is then the mass of the universe,
 measured in planck-mass units.
 So its not an uncountable cardinal; its much much smaller (
\emph on
viz.

\emph default
 finite) and its holding steady.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This speculation is in naive conflict with the Feynman path integral; there,
 the action is obtained from Lagrangian over all space-time (and not over
 the past light-cone) and the functional integral is over all of the many-worlds
 (and not over just the yet-to-be-glued-together ones).
 There might be a way of making the above speculation fit with this standard-iss
ue QFT, but it requires some subtlety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This speculation also seems to be at odds with the Hawking result that entropy
 is proportional to area (one-fourth the area).
 The area in turn goes as the mass-squared.
 By adscft this implies that the number of worlds should go as mass-squared
 of the universe not as the mass.
 So something is being mis-counted.
 Is it possible that there is a square-root in here? Viz: entropy is about
 thermodynamics and bits; many worlds is about qubits; in some sense perhaps
 this sneaks in the needed square-root to go from counting thermodynamics
 bits, to counting the number of many worlds? Something like this, perhaps?
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 large, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 qubits can be approximate by 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 classical bits.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, except that is exactly the number of (classical) bits needed to quantum-t
elelport 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 qubits.
 So in fact, the Bekenstein-Hawking bound is in perfect agreement with the
 estimate of the number of qubits.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Phenomenology: Two-state vector formalism 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "par:Pheonom:-Two-state-vector-formalism"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work on weak measurements suggests that the two-state vector formalism
 (TSVF) seems to be the correct formalism for describing quantum mechanics.
 The explicit dependence on the future seems to be consistent with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where a measurement at the current time seems to reach back in time, to
 twiddle and reconcile qubits in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what I can tell, the correctness of the TVSF is embraced in the quantum-com
puting world, where the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) is the 
\emph on
defacto
\emph default
 technique by which quantum computing is formulated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is meant to provide support for the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Space-time-is-emergent"

\end_inset

 principle that space-time is emergent.
 That is, quantum phenomena are not localized in either space, nor in time.
 The former, we've gotten used to, the latter, specifically, the acausal-like
 nature of wave-function collapse, still grates on many, but we have to
 accept it; we even have to accept a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version of it: the future alters the past.
 However, this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

acausality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is limited explicitly to qubits only.
 Future measurements alter qubits in the past, but cannot alter classical
 bits, which still flow in a causal, time-like fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Phenomenology: there are no electrically charged bosons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, there are: W+/-, but that's beside the point, the point being that
 electrons have spin half and that the spin is the ultimate source for the
 quantum effects, when coupled to the electric field.
 Viz spin is a twisting up of space.
 Rather than treating spin as a representation of the rotational symmetry
 of space, we should treat spin as a certain tangling up of multiple paths
 (e.g.
 paths in the sense of functional integral, or in the sense of Hamilton-Jacobi
 variational principle) so that we should envision these paths as a kind-of-like
 Hopf fibration – the paths are the fibers, the resulting fibration is an
 object that belongs to the 2 representation of SU(2).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, we treat quantum paths as if they were fibers, and then ask: how
 can we tangle them up, so that the grand-total holonomy behaves as if it
 were a spin-1/2 object? I suspect that such a tangling is impossible, without
 also pairing the object with a second one, i.e.
 in the sense of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum entanglement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does electric charge have to do with this? The idea here is that the
 electric charge at large distances looks like central-force attractive/repulsiv
e, and so one can ask about the geodesics of the free-falling electrically-charg
ed observer.
 The free-falling observer does fine, until he gets within a Compton-length
 of the electron, in which case there's a fibration of multiple paths that
 become possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, the point-like nature of the observer/geodesic becomes replaced
 by a spray(??) so that instead of saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a single thing is in multiple locations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (as is normally done in QM), we should instead say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there are multiple locations associated with a single thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which seems to be the same sentence, but is not): i.e.
 that space-time no longer has a simple structure at the microscopic level.
 The concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes flawed in some certain way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, Minkowski space seems to provide a valid description between
 the merely microscopic, and the Planck length, which is truly minuscule.
 Why?

Phenomenology: Macroscopic states have no phase
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "par:Practical:-Macroscopic-states"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a persistent confusion about the Schrödinger Cat state, which can
 be resolved by observing that there is no practical way of changing the
 phase of macroscopic states.
 There is no device that can do this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, it is commonly suggested that the Schrödinger cat state can be
 written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|Z\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\psi_{\mbox{dead}}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{\mbox{alive}}\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

but the problem/fallacy of the above expression is that there is no practical
 way of rotating the phase of either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave-function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, e.g.
 by applying some quantum gate.
 This implies that there is no way to construct the states 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|X\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\psi_{\mbox{dead}}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{\mbox{alive}}\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|Y\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\psi_{\mbox{dead}}\right\rangle +i\left|\psi_{\mbox{alive}}\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

which thus prevents measurements along any other qubit axes than the Z axis.
 This suggests that the Schrödinger cat

 is not really a quantum state at all.
 If one cannot manipulate it as a true qubit, then, by what abstraction

Phenomenology: The nature of a measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seems to be a lot of confusion about the nature of a measurement.
 The quantum eraser seems to highlight that confusion most clearly.
 The point is this: taking a quantum state, and sending it to two different
 physical locations, based on projections of its state, is not a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; it is merely the creation of entangled pairs with spatial separation.
 So: sending a photon through a birefringent crystal does not constitute
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; rather, its a just a variation of a two-slit experiment; phase coherence
 is not destroyed, and the two arms can be treated as the arms of an interferome
ter; the beams recombined.
 Similar remarks apply to the Stern-Gerlach magnets: in principle, if the
 magnetic fields and beam direction were precisely controlled, the phases
 would not be randomized, and the spin-1/2 beams in a Stern-Gerlach magnet
 could be recombined in a coherent fashion, forming an interferometer.
 These remarks apply, in particular, to the quarter-wave plates and polarizers
 of the quantum eraser: they are marking, not measuring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement occurs when the particle interacts with the detector; it
 is at this point that phase coherence is destroyed, and the situation turns
 into a Schrödinger-cat situation: there are no devices, no quantum-gates
 that can rotate a detection+non-detection state into some other orthogonal
 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Phenomenology: most wave-function collapses do not matter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a photon striking a photographic plate.
 Suppose that photon came from a single narrow slit, so that its QM description
 would be the typical QM wave illuminating the photographic plate.
 The wave function collapse here is when some-or-another grain of silver
 iodide absorbs the photon.
 The classical description of this event is to say that the photographic
 plate is now in a superposition of many states: any one of millions of
 silver-iodide crystals might have absorbed that photon, and so that plate
 is in a (macroscopic) superposition of millions of states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the future time evolution of that superposition.
 The plate might be shattered before it is developed, or maybe after.
 It might be discarded into a trash-heap before the experimenter looks at
 it.
 It might be discarded into a trash-heap after the experimenter looks at
 it, but considers the results so unimportant and uninteresting that they
 are promptly forgotten.
 Possibly the plate records something very important; the experimenter publishes
 a paper on what that plate recored.
 Did it matter if the important discovery in the plate was in the center,
 or shifted over a few centimeters one way or another?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here is that, in almost all photographic-plate superpositions,
 there are almost no long-time-period effects that are not thermalized.
 If the plate is broken before being developed, it is essentially thermalized
 immediately: all future timelines of the superposed plate are essentially
 equivalent.
 There is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for want of a nail, the shoe was lost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 effect.
 Thus, in this sense, (almost) all superpositions of the plate belong to
 the same equivalence class.
 One can pick a single representative from the equivalence class (
\emph on
viz
\emph default
, the photon explicitly hit this one crystal over here), and that single
 representative is sufficient to represent the forward time-like evolution
 of the universe.
 A different representative (
\emph on
viz
\emph default
, the photon explicitly hit this other crystal over there) gives the same
 result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies a certain duality: either a wave-function collapse did occur,
 but it thermalized and did not matter, or a wave-function collapse did
 not occur, and there is a thermalized superposition of shards of film-plate
 moving forward in time.
 Either ontological beleif (the collapse did occur; it did not occur) appears
 to describe essentially the same outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How long must one wait until thermalization? If the universe was described
 by infinite-precision real numbers, one might imagine after-shocks that
 continue a very long time.
 Insofar as the universe halts at the planck scale, that's where equivalence
 classes of superposed states become indistinguishable from any one member
 of that equivalence class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The upshot: things thermalize in finite time, not infinite time.
 After a finite time, which specific, actual wave-function collapse occured
 no longer matters; any other collapse has the same effect on the future
 universe.
 All the different many-world possibilities are erased, and consolidated
 into one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objection: the ultimate thermalizer would be an event horizon.
 We know that classical bits continue to live on the event horizon; where
 did the qubits go, when they crossed? Are the classical bits on an event
 horizon exacly what is neeed to quantum-teleport qubits fom the other side?
 
\emph on
Viz
\emph default
, one needs 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 classical bits to quantum-teleport 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 qubits; the mass of the black hole is proportional to the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 qubits; the area of the event horizon is propotional to the mass-squared,
 and thus is equal to the number of classical bits needed to teleport those
 qubits to the other side.
 Can we conclude: event horizons do not destroy qubits? Equivalently, mass
 and qubits are the same thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Phenomenology: classical approximations of the qubit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of entangled particles in a quantum eraser setup allows one to at
 least partly 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fake it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: given enough measurements, one can use the record of the measurements,
 recorded as classical bits, to reconstruct interference patterns, or not,
 by selectively ignoring certain measurements (i.e.
 by ignoring certain bit-streams, those bit-streams of classical bits that
 recorded certain detections corresponding to certain placements of polarizers
 and quarter-wave places).
 However, this reconstruction and erasure of interference patterns from
 classical bits can only be done at certain phase angles: the collected
 data is not enough to alter the phase, post-facto, to any arbitrary value.
 That is, the quantum eraser setup (with an entangled pair) is enough to
 classically emulate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 but is not enough to emulate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for any arbitrary phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, post-facto (after the measurement).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does suggest that a tripartite entanglement, e.g.
 a GHZ state, used in a quantum-eraser setup, might allow one to build a
 better approximation of a qubit by multiple classical measurements, e.g.
 at phases at multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/3$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing in this direction, an entangled state of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 particles can be used to approximate a (single) qubit at phase angles of
 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Continuing in this train of thought, the large-
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 limit of entanglement perhaps resembles a very highly mixed black hole.
 This suggests that a series of quantum-eraser-style measurements against
 such a black hole allows one to model the full Bloch sphere (or a single
 qubit) with the classical bits recording the results of measurements: in
 a sense, a single black hole, being the large-
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 limit, could be taken to represent (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

be

Speculative framework: fibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the idea that a wave function is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particle in multiple places at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, consider then a fibration where points on the fibers are the different
 space-time locations for the particle.
 The base space consists of particles, themselves.
 Specifically, the base-space is some very high-dimensional representation
 of a Lie algebra, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are the decomposition of that rep into various irreducible reps.
 Obvious stumbling blocks: in what sense can a rep be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the base space of the fibration could be the spin group.
 If the spin group is decomposed into spinors, then the fiber above the
 spinor records the possible spatial locations that spinor could have.
 A distribution on the fiber then corresponds to the wave function of that
 particular spinor.
 Since the decomposition of the spin group into Weyl spinors depends on
 the choice of basis, then picking a different basis corresponds to (among
 other things) the exchange of identical particles.
 In that sense, we get the Pauli exclusion principle 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; it is deduced from the starting point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 Fibration is the wrong concept here.
 Sheaves, sections, etales, topi are more appropriate.
 Its not so much that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particle is in multiple places at once
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; rather, a particle is in multiple sections of space-time at once.
 The particle is fixed, it is being blasted into different parts of space-time
 by the Yoneda lemma.
 Space-time isn't single-valued, kind-of-like in the sense of a Grothendieck
 topology: there are multiple parts to it, they are joined together in a
 sheaf-like way.

how can there be two spaces at once for a single particle?

\end_inset

 An insight into this is provided by Urs Shreiber in his 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because Deligne

 blog post.
 Start by observing that the Poincaré group (call it G) is the isometry
 group of Minkowski space (it acts transitively).
 The Lorentz group (call it H) is the subgroup that fixes points (its the
 stabilizer).
 Thus, we can take the quotient G/H to be Minkowski space itself: So G/H
 is an example of a Klein geometry.
 The tangent space is H, and if we promote it to a local symmetry i.e.
 use it to define the vielbeins or frame fields, then one gets Cartan spaces
 (or General Relativity in the case of Poincaré=Iso(3,1))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to associate a massive particle with every possible connection
 consistent with their being a massive particle.
 That is, start with some fixed background geometry, satisfying the classical
 Einstein equations.
 Next, consider all possible perturbations to the background geometry, consisten
t with the presence of a fixed small mass.
 Call this space P.
 For each such perturbation, there is a perturbation to the vierbeins (by
 abuse of notation, call this P also).
 Natural questions include: when are two such perturbations smoothly homotopic?
 Can we define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be the class of all homotopic perturbations? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this vision is that we don't yet have a measure for the
 space P (although we know that it needs to be the Feynman path integral).
 So: consider two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nearby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 perturbations (two points in P).
 The task at hand is to derive a scalar action (Klein-Gordon Lagrangian)
 relating these two points, given a starting point of requiring only that
 the perturbations are consistent with the Einstein eqns.
 How might one do this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one has just a single perturbation of this sort, and asks about its time-evol

 a (point) particle in a gravitational field.

\begin_layout Standard
Note: another way of thinking about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

because Deligne
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

where the integration takes place over all possible worlds.
 One can regain a single macroscopic reality while retaining all quantum
 predictions by limiting the integration to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 domain, and specifically, only below the scale of the Penrose Planck mass.
 But how might one go about doing this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, lets look at a typical interference experiment.
 Here, one has wave-fuctions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for two states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 on the different arms of the interferometer.
 The many-worlds integration to be performed is over the pahse angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 – and, to be precise, it really needs to be performed over the qubit Bloch
 sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

 and it really needs to be performed over a mixed state, viz.
 given a probabilistic weight for each pure state.
 This kind of integral is doable and possible because its essentially a
 two-particle integral, whereas the QFT path integral 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is over infinite particle states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to get from a two-particle state to an infinite-particle state is
 to consider the tensor algebra, and specifically, the exterior algebra.
 Thus, the Feynman integral looks like an integral over the symmetric algebra
 (for bosons) and the exerior algebra (for fermions).
 Except that, for fermions, we kind-of know that it has to be over the Clifford
 algebra, instead.
 As one's thoughts plotz down this corridor, its kind-of impossible to bump
 into all the concepts that enrich string theory; so this speculation is
 more of an

 from hawking radiation/entropy.
 So, there seem to be conflicting ideas: the mass of thermodynamic systems
 goes up in proportion to the heat energy (see Planck, Max (1907), "Zur

 so if you melt ice, the mass of the melt-water is greater than that of
 the original ice.
 Relatedly, there's a mass loss from binding energy.
 However, the relation of binding energy to entropy is opaque: when a system
 is bound, did the number of accessible states decrease? It would seem so:
 the ionized state is not accessible to the system.
 However, one does not normally associate an entropy with a QM system, but
 the goal is to argue that the entropy of atomic hydrogen is less than that

\begin_layout Standard
What he is saying is that spin is angular momentum.
 This feels like a tautology, so its worth clarifying the difference.
 Spin is described by representations of the Lorentz group.
 That is, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

classical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 field can be understood as a (square-integrable) function from Minkowski
 space to a given, fixed representation of the Lorentz group.
 The representation defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the field.
 One might say that a classical field is a section of an associated fiber
 bundle over the base space of Minkowski space, with the principal bundle
 having fibers that are the Lorentz group.
 Thus, the associated bundle has fibers that transform under the Lorentz
 group.
 i.e.
 transform as representations of the Lorentz group.
 The label on the representation is the spin.
 
\end_layout

However, the definition of angular momentum requires the Poincaré group,
 because momentum is defined as the generator of translational symmetry,

 of the base space.
 That is, the Poincaré group acts on both the fiber and on the base space.
 To have things actually be consistent, one wants to be able to identify
 angular momentum with spin, so that eigenstates of the angular momentum
 operator (which is defined only in the Poincaré algebra) correspond to
 eigenstates of the spin operator in the Lorentz algebra.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to do this.
 One way is to consider a single point in space-time, fix it, and then consider
 the tangent space to that point: as a tangent space, it contains derivatives
 of the field (derivatives in the space-time directions), and Lie derivatives
 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vertical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 space, along the fiber, i.e.
 valued in the Lorentz algebra.
 For a fixed spin representation, this is exactly the same thing as having
 the space-time derivatives be labeled by the Lorentz-algebra spin labels
 – this is why fields are always algebra-valued.
 At this point, one notes that the momentum and angular momentum operators
 of the Poincaré algebra act on that tangent space.
 Turing the crank, one discovers that spin can be interpreted as angular
 momentum.
 This is how most textbooks demonstrate the equality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to do this is to take a specific section of the fiber bundle,
 a specific field configuration, and ask what happens there.
 That is, instead of restricting to the algebra at a fixed point in space-time,
 one wants to ask about the structure of the function space, the structure
 of the Banach space of all functions defined on the base space.
 To answer this, one needs to do what Ohanian does.
 So, instead of working in the tangent space of a single point in space-time,
 he chooses to work in the space of all (square-integrable) functions.
 Yes, one expects to get the same answer, either way, but it is not entirely
 a foregone conclusion that this would be the case: now that the distinction
 being made above is explicit, one could certainly create insane configurations
 where the spin is not equal to the angular momentum.
 (this is kind-of what is happening with anyons!??)

 (Actually, fermions are not grassmann numbers; they belong to the spin

A1: Spin algebra?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conservative argument says that it comes from fermions, and specifically,
 the spin algebra.
 The spin algebra is built from a real Clifford algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V\otimes\mathbb{C}=W\oplus\overline{W}
\]

\end_inset

(see e.g.
 Jurgen Jost, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Riemannian Geometry and Geometry Analysis, page 69) where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a real Clifford algebra (itself built from a tensor algebra!) and is
 generated from 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 components in order to describe 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 Weyl spinors and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 conjugate spinors.
 One cannot get the required spin structure without using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 in this construction.
 This argument makes sense because most 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, in order for fermions to exist, a bundle must be a spin structure.
 i.e.
 is a lift of a frame bundle to a double-covering of SO(N) by Spin(N).
 The usual remarks apply.
 But this works only for neutral fermions.
 For charged fermions, the bundle must have a Spinc structure, where as
 per usual notation, its a twisted product 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{Spin}^{\mathbb{C}}(n)=\mbox{Spin}(n)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}\mbox{U}(1)
\]

\end_inset

i.e.
 the U(1) carries the electromagnetism.
 This paragraph is non-controversial, its the orthodox interpretation.
 The next question asks: is there another way? Or is it just a very basic
 confusion about the proliferation of complex numbers all shot-through QM
 and Clifford/spin algebra?

A2: Electromagnetism? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wild guess: Perhaps the complex phase is actually a hidden side-effect of

 that the Aharonov-Bohn effect is most easily, most geometrically understood
 in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pre-quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fashion, as a holonomy of the U(1) fiber bundle.
 Thus, even before we perform any quantization, and just stick to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pre-quantization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we already get a complex phase that arises naturally, but only due to
 the electromagnetic structure on the fibre bundle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classifying space for U(1) bundles is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and the thing about 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is that it is exactly the same things as a Hilbert space on which QM is
 naturally formulated.
 It is complex, because wave-functions are complex-valued, its projective,
 because only normalized wave functions matter.
 We can identify the Hilbert space with the occupation states of the simple
 harmonic oscillator.

Some minor insight might be gleaned by reviewing the structure of

 The cellular structure (cell complex) of

 Novikov,

 That is, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{CP}^{\infty}=\kappa^{0}\cup\kappa^{2}\cup\kappa^{4}\cup\cdots
\]

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\kappa^{2n}=\mathbb{CP}^{n}\backslash\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}=\left\{ \left.\left(z_{0}:\cdots:z_{n}\right)\right|:z_{j}\ne0\;\forall\,j\right\} \simeq D^{2n}
\]

\end_inset

where by abuse of notation, the above makes the mistake of writing a cell,
 which is actually a map of a disk, with the disk itself.
 Oh well.
 This is just a mnemonic reminder, that's all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that a single qubit is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 qubits are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

, etc.
 The reason that qubits are projective is because only the relative phases
 of wave-functions matter, and the amplitude of a wave function is always
 normalized to one.
 Specifically, a single qubit is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{CP}^{1}=\left\{ z_{0}\left|\uparrow\right\rangle +z_{1}\left|\downarrow\right\rangle \left|\left|z_{0}\right|^{2}+\left|z_{1}\right|^{2}=1,\;z_{0}/z_{1}\mbox{ real}\right.\right\} \simeq S^{2}

A4: Counter-counter-argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've invoked the rotation group, the inevitable is in store.
 Namely, vectors belong to the adjoint rep of the rotation group.
 Maxwell equations are exactly the same thing as a statement about the transform
ation properties of these vectors under the action of the Poincaré group.
 That is, the electric and magnetic fields are vectors in the Lorentz algebra,
 i.e.
 live in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vertical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fibers, the fibers being in the associated bundle of the Lorentz group.
 The actual transformation properties of these vectors, under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horizontal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 translations in Minkowski space, are given by the Poincaré algebra.
 These are exactly equal to the Maxwell equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation
 is due to the fact that the wave equation is just the quadratic Casimir
 operator of the Poincaré algebra.
 (A worthy exercise is to write down the details to support these claims).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Opaque in the above construction is how U(1) arises.
 The Poincaré algebra gave us a differential structure.
 To get the A field from the E,B fields requires the notion of differential
 topology, i.e.
 the notion of closed forms for the E-field, and exact forms for the B-field.
 These last two statements follows from the fact that electric charges exist,
 magnetic ones don't (except in the form of a holonomy).
 So why should electric charges exist, but magnetic ones not? This is partly
 answered by looking at the representation theory of the Poincaré group:
 it has massive particles in it.
 These can have an electric charge, because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

electric charge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 both point in the same direction: i.e.
 in the time-like direction.
 By contrast, magnetic monopoles could only be consistent with imaginary
 mass, i.e.
 tachyonic degrees of freedom.
 So the Poincaré algebra is really a kind of no-go for magnetic monopoles.
 This last sentence is highly textbook non-standard, and so needs to be
 fully fleshed out in detail, as it is non-obvious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once one deduces that the Poincaré algebra effectively prohibits magnetic
 monopoles (except in the form of a holonomy) then the standard machinery
 of differential topology allows one to deduce U(1) from the A field.

 To repeat them here: consider the finite-dimensional simplex of probabilities

 Consider the change of variable

 so that the simplex is mapped to a quadrant of a sphere:

 Consider the the flat metric in the Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $y=(y_{1},\cdots,y_{n})$
\end_inset

 This flat metric induces a metric on the sphere.
 Converting coordinates back to the

 one finds that the flat Euclidean metric has become the Fisher information

 metric on

 That is, to compute the distance between two complex-valued wave functions,

Put another way: the difference in the information between two wave functions
 is just their difference, but constrained to the fact that they live in

 The projective nature of it all makes the formulas look complicated, obscuring

Wave function collapse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other assorted ideas about wave-function collapse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Wave function collapse is comultiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spin algebra that describes Weyl spinors is constructed from a Clifford
 algebra, as mentioned above.
 The Clifford algebra is in turn constructed from the tensor algebra.
 The part that is of interest here is that the tensor algebra posses a Hopf
 algebra structure, and I believe (should double-check) that this Hopf structure
 survives all the way to to the spin algebra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may then ask the question: what corresponds to comultiplication in the
 Hopf algebra? One seemingly plausible answer is that it corresponds to
 wave-function collapse.
 That is, if one has a single fermion (single Weyl spinor) 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, under comultiplication, it passes over to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta(v)=1\boxtimes v+v\boxtimes1
\]

\end_inset

where I used 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes$
\end_inset

 to perversely note the tensor product of two tensor algebras, so as not
 to confuse it with the tensor product that is internal to the tensor algebra
 itself (which is a fatal mistake).
 (I steal this idea from the Wikipedia article on the topic, which is OK,
 since I wrote that Wikipedia article! Catch-22) That is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(c)\in TV\boxtimes TV$
\end_inset

.
 What does this mean? How can one interpret this? Well, if 
\begin_inset Formula $TV$
\end_inset

, or more precisely, the spin algebra constructed from 
\begin_inset Formula $TV$
\end_inset

 describes the configuration of some number of number of spinors in the
 universe, (including the fact that they obey the Grassmann algebra, i.e.
 Pauli exclusion), then one must conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $TV\boxtimes TV$
\end_inset

 describes two universes, i.e.
 two worlds of the many-worlds hypothesis.
 The comultiplication above is stating that these two universes are in superposi
tion (the box 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes$
\end_inset

 is still a tensor product; its bilinear; so the superposition is captured
 by this expression).
 However, it is also stating that the fermion that is NOT at a particular
 location in one universe, is in that location in a different universe.
 i.e.
 the collapse proceeded so that, in each universe, the fermion ends up in
 a different position (and that all of these collapsed states are still
 coherent).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 This needs more work.
 We want to say that the fermion collapsed to different locations/momenta
 in different universes, and the above does not make that clear.
 I think this is a notational deficiency...

 Then with enough geometric sophistication, ...

 This fails due to a key misperception.
 The maximally-entangled Bell states require not one, but two pairs of entangled

 For a while it feels like this can be avoideed, evaded, but not so.
 So this attempt at a geometric attack fails, because the entangled system
 cannot be described by a single dynamical, geometrical point.
 Well, it can, but they are glued together in such a way that a measurement
 singles out one of the two; this is the collapse, and the below fails to

Cool, but incomplete.
 Several problems.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi:M\to\mathbb{C}$

 has no geometry, it is a scalar field.
 By convention, we set

\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle \in U(1)$
\end_inset

.
 This is acceptable, but is kind-of misleading.
 First, there are no true scalars in nature.
 Second, it isn't obvious that if there were, that there woulldn't be anything
 that is preventing the time evolution

 There's no reason for a scalar wave function not to be homotopic to zero,
 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$

\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$

 What I don't have is any description of a spinor as a topological soliton.
 I believe that such a description exists; I've never seen one in a textbook.
 One of the goals here is to provide this description explicitly.
 If it is a topological solition, then there is an argument that one can
 have time evoltion that

\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle \in U(1)\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}$

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is enough to account for the spin direction, but we still need to have
 an extra phase if we are going to write a normal two-component Weyl spinor.
 This extra phase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

doesn't matter
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi|\psi\right\rangle =1$

throw it away
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But the Aharonov-Bohm effect, and also the neutron interferometer in gravity
 both require the holonomy of the circle bundle for the proper explanation,
 so we can't just throw the phase away.

 So if a point in

 The Hopf fibration is non-trivial ...

Lets stick to the sigma model, so time evolution is just the kinetic term,

\begin_layout Subsection
Laplacians and Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where do Laplacians come from? Why is there a quadratic differential operator
 everywhere? There are two clues I want to assemble here: the Berezin integral,
 and Kirchoff's theorem for a graph.
 The story goes as follows: Start with a Clifford algebra, and build the
 spin group for even N for it.
 Factor the spin group into Weyl spinors.
 These naturally anti-commute, by construction.
 Throw away the spin aspects of this construction, but keep the anti-commuting
 aspects.
 This leads to the Berezin integral:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\,A=\int\exp\left[-\theta A\eta\right]d\eta d\theta
\]

\end_inset

for Grassmann variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and an ordinary matrix A.
 This is abridged standard textbook stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, Kirchoff's theorem for a graph states, more or less, that, when one
 has a graph, and one constructs the Laplacian matrix of the graph (by taking
 a difference of its adjacency matrix, and a diagonal degree matrix), then
 the determinant of that matrix is given by a sum over all spanning trees
 of the graph.
 Inverting this argument: if you have a determinant, then, by change of
 basis, try to turn it into the Laplacian of some graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This seems to do two things: It tells you that, to first order, the interaction
 of N particles really is a tree, has to be a tree, or rather, a sum of
 trees.
 Next, it tells you that, from the graph-theoretic point of view, it has
 to be the Laplacian that accomplishes this.
 But, from physics, we know that Laplacians are associated with kinetic
 energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it seems that, by merely assuming the Clifford algebra, (or assuming
 the spin algebra), we are forced to conclude that the Laplacian, i.e.
 kinetic energy, describes the situation.
 This, to me is really remarkable.
 I've never heard of this before.
 To deduce the necessity of Laplacians from the existence of Clifford algebras?
 Wow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another way to get to Laplacians.
 One standard textbook approach is to assume the existence of a Riemannian
 manifold, build the tangent space, then point out that the exp function
 generates geodesics on the manifold (maps tangent vectors to geodesics),
 and then observe that geodesics can be obtained by solving for the extremum
 of either the length or the energy of smooth, differentiable paths on the
 manifold.
 The one and the other construction give a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian point
 of view, and both end up requiring a second-order differential operator
 applied to the path.
 Thus, geodesics on Riemannian manifold necessarily involve a second-order
 differential operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can try to apply this argument in reverse: Assume a Clifford algebra,
 deduce the existence of a Laplacian, and then deduce that a Riemannian
 manifold is the necessary home for the resulting dynamics.
 In other words, by assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 indistinguishable fermions, we are forced to deduce Riemannian geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we start with the spinc group instead of the spin group, is there some
 way that this forces you to deduce pseudo-Riemannian geometry? The reason
 I think this is a plausible question is because the extra 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

 degree of freedom in the spinc group might force one into using a (massless)
 gauge boson when one attempts to write the Berezin integral.
 (I mean, that degree of freedom has to go somewhere ..
 where else can it possibly go?) If that is the case, then it seems that
 the Maxwell equations are forced on us, whether we like it or not, and
 then the Maxwell equations necessarily imply special relativity, which
 necessarily imply a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other things that this construction is doing is to force the use of
 the partition function.
 That is, the Berezin integral is forcing us to take a functional-integral
 description of the situation.
 And more strongly: not just any functional integral, but necessarily over
 something that involves a second-order differential operator ...
 one that is summed over.
 Namely, the action.
 And we already know that we can view quantum mechanics as the necessary
 outcome or by-product of employing functional integrals over the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third interesting thing gets entangled here: why is space-time 3+1 dimensional
? The hand-waving here is that spinors are necessarily objects that inhabit
 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$
\end_inset

 viz, the Lorentz group, and this leads to the adjoint rep being 3+1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this can be made rigorous, then this is a direct path between what are
 normally viewed as very distant topics.
 We start with a rather weak assumption – Clifford algebras, and get a rainbow
 of physics paraphernalia falling out, including *

\begin_layout Paragraph*
But why Laplacian, really?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The determinant could have been written as a product of eigenvalues, so
 why would one want to write the matrix perversely as a Laplacian? I presume
 that it is something about the spin factorization that is forcing this.
 More precisely, a graph Laplacian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 can be factored as a pair of oriented edge incidence matrices: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=EE^{T}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 has a +1 at the head of an arrow (oriented edge) and a -1 at the tail.
 Presumably, it is something about the spinor factorization that causes
 us to talk about edges (perhaps the edges connect the two components of
 the spinor?) 
\end_layout

 Shades of de Broglie–Bohm theory.
 Whoa.

Some of the speculations above seem to actually require more precise notational
 conventions.
 Write these down, so as to avoid screwups.

\begin_layout Subsection
The two sphere
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recurring theme 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}\cong\mathbb{CP}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is the Bloch sphere, consisting of linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\uparrow\right\rangle =\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle =\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|\uparrow\right\rangle +\beta\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, so that is a total of four real numbers.
 Next 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi|\psi\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{*}\alpha+\beta^{*}\beta=1$
\end_inset

 leaves three real numbers.
 Phase ambiguity implies only two real numbers to get a point on the Bloch
 sphere.
 The third number, the phase, is physically real, in that it shows up in
 Bohm-Aharonov, and cannot be swept away; it also implies that it must be
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

 of electromagnetism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal here is to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as a pure state, and specifically, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a single fiber of some fiber bundle.
 That is, it is just marking a spin direction for one point in spacetime.
 Given a spacetime point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the fiber above 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(x\right)=\left\langle x|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 which has a real magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x\right)=\left\Vert \psi\left(x\right)\right\Vert ^{2}=\left|\psi^{*}\left(x\right)\psi\left(x\right)\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here is ambiguous.
 There are several possible interpretations.
 The classical interpretation is to associate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as a single point on the Bloch sphere.
 (I think this is the mental model most physicists use).
 Another interpretation is to associate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with Killing fields on the Bloch sphere.
 We'll be using the second interpretation; this is required to overcome
 technical problems relating to Clebsh–Gordan coeficients for the two-particle
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this time, no physical assumptions about mixed states are being made;
 in particular, the density matrix is NOT assumed! This is because I want
 to leave open the door to a more general concept of mixed states as arbitrary
 probability distributions on the surface of the Bloch sphere, rather than
 as points in it's interior, as standard QM density matrix formalism requires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per Wikipedia, a single point on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 can be paramterized by Hopf coordinates: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha=e^{i\varphi}\cos\eta\quad\mbox{and \ensuremath{\quad\beta=e^{i\varphi}e^{i\xi}}\ensuremath{\sin\eta}}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\eta\le\pi/2$
\end_inset

: attention, this is NOT the usual sphere coord, its off by a factor of
 two! So 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\uparrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The longitude is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\xi\le2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The phase is 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\varphi}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two-sphere has three Killing vector fields.
 So, basicaly, treat 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 as a symmetric space.
 The Killing field algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}\cong\mathfrak{su}\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 splits into
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{m}\oplus\mathfrak{h}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{m}\cong TS^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{h}\cong\mathfrak{u}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 is the stabilizer subalgebra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume that this is equivalent to the Hopf fibration, but this needs to
 be double-checked, with explicit expressions given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hairy ball theorem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, vector fields on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 cannot be combed, which is why the stabilizer 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{h}$
\end_inset

 is not vacant.
 Picking a single point on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to picking a Killing field that is vanishing at that point.
 The other two are not, they are tangent to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}S^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the point on the Bloch sphere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest problem with using Killing fields to represent a point is that
 there will also be a second spot somewhere on the sphere where a given
 Killing field must vanish.
 This problem can be avoided by noting that a given fixed Killing field
 is just one representative out of an infinite set of such fields.
 Infinite set because, at each point on the spehre, we are free to choose
 any coordinate frame we like; the Killing fields can be any wild, crazy
 combing of hair, as long as we recognize thier algebra is the algebra of
 the isometries, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{su}\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 correspond to the coset of all Killing fields that vanish at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A pure state is meant to be represented by a single point on the Bloch sphere.
 The manipulation of a pure state, e.g.
 by rotating it via some device, move the point on the Bloch sphere.
 The phase is interpreted as residing in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{h}$
\end_inset

 part, That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\in\mathfrak{h}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 from above, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\varphi}\in U\left(1\right)\cong S^{1}$
\end_inset

 is the overall phase.
 Thus, one expects holonomy effects to arise if the spin is moved about
 a closed path.
 TODO: provide explcit expressions for the holonomy.

\begin_layout Subsection
The two-spin system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal here is to represent an entangled state of two qubits.
 Naively, this is an element in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{4}$
\end_inset

, which we will decompose into spinors, and apply normalization constraints.
 This follows the usual algebra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the tricky part: this is not a fiber over a single spacetime; it
 has two spatial coordinates, one for each spinor.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the spacetime manifold, the two-spin system is a fiber over the base
 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times M$
\end_inset

.
 It has two spatial positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the general two-particle state will be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|\psi_{B}\right\rangle =\left(\alpha_{A}\left|\uparrow_{A}\right\rangle +\beta_{A}\left|\downarrow_{A}\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left(\alpha_{B}\left|\uparrow_{B}\right\rangle +\beta_{B}\left|\downarrow_{B}\right\rangle \right)
\]

\end_inset

Note the tensor product makes it bilinear.
 Expanding this gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi_{A}\right\rangle \otimes\left|\psi_{B}\right\rangle =\alpha_{A}\alpha_{B}\left|\uparrow_{A}\uparrow_{B}\right\rangle +\alpha_{A}\beta_{B}\left|\uparrow_{A}\downarrow_{B}\right\rangle +\beta_{A}\alpha_{B}\left|\downarrow_{A}\uparrow_{B}\right\rangle +\beta_{A}\beta_{B}\left|\downarrow_{A}\downarrow_{B}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary issue with the above expression is that a two-particle state
 cannot be determined by a pair of points on the Bloch sphere.
 For example, Bell states are the maximally entangled states.
 These are, in conventional notation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left|\Phi^{+}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\uparrow\uparrow\right\rangle +\left|\downarrow\downarrow\right\rangle \right)\\
\left|\Phi^{-}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\uparrow\uparrow\right\rangle -\left|\downarrow\downarrow\right\rangle \right)\\
\left|\Psi^{+}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle +\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle \right)\\
\left|\Psi^{-}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle -\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle \right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and there is no choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 that can express the above just a single pair of spin-1/2 states.
 So for example, to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Phi^{+}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 set 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{A}=\alpha_{B}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{A}=-\beta_{B}=i$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left|\psi\,1\,i\right\rangle  & =\left(\left|\uparrow_{A}\right\rangle +i\left|\downarrow_{A}\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left(\left|\uparrow_{B}\right\rangle -i\left|\downarrow_{B}\right\rangle \right)\\
 & =\left|\uparrow\uparrow\right\rangle -i\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle +i\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle +\left|\downarrow\downarrow\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and also 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left|\psi\,1\,-i\right\rangle  & =\left(\left|\uparrow_{A}\right\rangle -i\left|\downarrow_{A}\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left(\left|\uparrow_{B}\right\rangle +i\left|\downarrow_{B}\right\rangle \right)\\
 & =\left|\uparrow\uparrow\right\rangle +i\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle -i\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle +\left|\downarrow\downarrow\right\rangle 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

in order to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\Phi^{+}\right\rangle =\left|\psi\,1\,i\right\rangle +\left|\psi\,1\,-i\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

up to normalization.
 Thus, at least two pairs of points on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 are needed! One pair is not enough! This is the root cause of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave function collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; a measurement of a Bell state discards one of these two possibilities.

\begin_layout Standard
That is, we need to work with states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|j\,m\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-1,0,+1$
\end_inset

 and thus a generic two-particle state is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi_{AB}\right\rangle =\zeta\left|j=1\;m=-1\right\rangle +\eta\left|j=1\;m=0\right\rangle +\theta\left|j=1\;m=+1\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

requires three complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta,\eta,\theta$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{6}$
\end_inset

.
 (Requiring normaliztion knocks this down, etc.) The point here is that a
 generic 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{AB}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 cannot be written as a single pair of points on the Bloch sphere; it requires
 two pairs of points.
