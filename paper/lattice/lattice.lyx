\layout Abstract

This paper reviews connections between the Bernoulli map, the baker's map
 and the Ising model.
 The Bernoulli map is possibly the simplest exactly solvable model of determinis
tic chaos.
 Its Frobenius-Perron operator or transfer operator has a set of well-known
 polynomial eigenvectors, given by the Bernoulli polynomials.
 Its also has a set of smooth but non-integrable eigenvectors given by the
 Hurwitz zeta function.
 Alternately, it has a set of fractal eigenvectors, of which the Blancmange
 or Takagi curve is one.
\layout Abstract

An even larger set of functions that are eigenvectors of the Bernoulli operator
 may be obtained by considering a one dimensional lattice model, such as
 the Ising model.
 Functions that are translationally invariant on a one-dimensional lattice
 are nothing more or less than eigenvectors of the Bernoulli operator with
 eigenvalue one.
 These functions, when graphed on the real number line, are in general not
 even continuous.
 
\layout Abstract

Functins that are continuous-nowhere are traditionally considered to be
 intractible, and usually, very little can be said about them.
 By identifying them with a set of simple, tractable operations on a one-dimensi
onal lattice model, one obtains a set of tools with which to manipulate
 and analyze such functions.
\layout Abstract

A notable example of a discontinuouis-everywhere function that is not traditiona
lly integrable, yet, when properly defined, can be integrated, is derivative
 of the Minkowski question mark function.
 It, and its generalizations are known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi-fractal measures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, this paper explores what it means to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

take the derivative of the question mark function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 As a side-effect, all of the various functions that occur have a particular
 fractal self-symmetry, which can be made explicitly manifest; it is the
 symmetry of the dyadic monoid, that is, the period-doubling subset of the
 modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.

Intro
\layout Standard

THIS IS A DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS.
 The intro hasn't been written yet, but if it was, it would work like this:
 
\layout Standard

Exactly solvable chaotic dynamical systems are interesting because they
 provide insight into the behaviour of chaotic dynamical systems 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

in the large
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The simplest exactly solvable model of deterministic chaos is the iterated
 Bernoulli map
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Dri99}

\end_inset 

.
 It is a map of the unit interval onto itself, given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b(x)=2x\mbox{ mod }1\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Picking some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 irrational 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 and then iterating this map, one sees 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 bounce all over the unit interval: the map is ergodic.
 One may compute correlation functions for it, and other statistical measures.
\layout Standard

One method for studying a chaotic map is in terms of its Frobenius-Perron
 or transfer operator.
 The utility of the transfer operator can be introduced by an appeal to
 physics, and the statistical mechanics of continuum systems.
 The argument goes as follows: while iterated maps have a point dynamics
 that bounces all over the place, in nature, physical observables are smooth.
 Therefore, one should study the dynamics of a smooth distrubution of particles
 under the action of chaotic operators.
 The transfer operator gives exactly such an opportunity.
 It is defined as a certain map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 is some collection of functions on the unit interval.
 For example one may take 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{P}(x)$
\end_inset 

 the set of polynomials in one variable, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=L^{2}([0,1])$
\end_inset 

 the set of square-integral functions on the unit interval.
 Given some iterated function (for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $b(x)$
\end_inset 

), it is defined as the map 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}f=g\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $f,g\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 such that, on a pointwise basis, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g(x)=\sum_{y\in b^{-1}(x)}\;\frac{f(y)}{b^{\prime}(y)}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\prime}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 When the pre-image 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset 

 is not a countable collection of points, the sum may be replaced by an
 integral.
 The transfer operator can be defined with varying degrees of sophistication
 and rigor, and can be found in many places in the literature; simple, workable
 definitions can be found in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Dri99,Ve-Tr04}

\end_inset 

.
 In short, while iterating a function such as 
\begin_inset Formula $b(x)$
\end_inset 

 gives the time evolution of a point, iterating the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 gives the time evolution of a smooth distribution.
 A general feature that is physically appealing is that the transfer operator
 typically has only one eigenstate associated with an eigenvalue of 1: this
 is the ground state or equilibrium state.
 All other eigenstates are associated with real eigenvalues that are less
 than one: upon iteration, the associated eigenstates must necessarily die
 away geometrically.
 This behaviour is physically appealing: it describes the approach to equilibriu
m of a system that may initially be far from equilibrium, and it provides
 a set of time scales at which that approach is made.
\layout Standard

The transfer operator of the Bernoulli map is called the Bernoulli operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 and is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}f\right](x)=g(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\; f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{1+x}{2}\right)\;\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 is the space of polynomials, the eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L_{B}}$
\end_inset 

 are the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

, and are associated with the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Gas92,Dri99,Ve-B04}

\end_inset 

.
 The constant function 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}(x)=1$
\end_inset 

 is associated with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset 

; it is the only non-decaying eigenfunction associated with the iteration
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

: the equilibrium state is a constant distribution.
 The spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 is discrete.
\layout Standard

If one considers a larger space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

, then one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 has a larger set of eigenvalues.
 For example, if one considers the collection 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(0,1)$
\end_inset 

 of infinitly-differentiable functions on the 
\emph on 
open
\emph default 
 unit interval (
\emph on 
i.e
\emph default 
.
 not containing the endpoints), then the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 is continuous, and takes on all values in the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset 

 of the complex plane.
 The eigenstates are given by the Hurwitz zeta function
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ve-B04}

\end_inset 

.
 The spectrum is degenerate, in that there are multiple eigenstates associated
 with each eigenvalue.
 Curiously, linear combinations of the Hurwitz zeta function may be taken,
 constructing the fractal Blancmange or Takagi curve.
 That is, for every eigenvalue on the complex unit disk, there is a correspondin
g fractal curve that is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

, with that fractal having a dyadic self-symmetry.
 The Takagi curve is continuous but differentiable nowhere; however, it
 is bounded, and it is integrable.
 In this larger space, there is still only one unique eigenvector with eigenvalu
e one: this is still the constant function.
 
\layout Standard

There is yet a larger space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 that one may consider, and this is the space of functions that are continuous
 nowhere on the unit interval and are unbounded in magnitude, but are, in
 a certain sense, integrable.
 In classical analysis, such functions are outcasts, seemingly intractible
 and uncoercible.
 However, they may in fact be constructed in a very natural fashion: these
 are functions on the state space of a one-dimensional lattice model.
 They may be mapped to the unit interval with the dyadic mapping, and when
 mapped in this way, are plainly discontinuous and generally beastly.
 However, the lattice posses an alternate topology, which makes these functions
 not only manipulable but well-studied.
 Examples of functions on the lattice include the energy of the Ising model,
 or the Boltzmann probability distribution of the set of states of the Ising
 model.
 In the lattice model, the Bernoulli map corresponds to nothing more than
 the shift of the lattice by one: a translation of the lattice.
 The eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 are simply functions whose magnitude changes geometrically as the lattice
 is shifted by one: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

is just the shift operator.
 Curiously, there is now a very large class of functions associated with
 the eigenvalue one: this is the class of translation-invariant functions.
\layout Standard

The remainder of this paper is devoted to an exposition of the lattice-model
 construction of eigenstates of the transfer operator.
 An exploration is made not only of the Bernoulli map, which corresponds
 to a one-sided lattice, but also to the baker's map, which corresponds
 to a two-sided lattice.
 Since such continuous-nowhere functions seem outrageous, a motivation for
 this study is provided in the next section.
 It is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi-fractal measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, the derivative of the Minkowski question mark function, which is continuous
 nowhere, and unbounded, and yet is integrable.
 As multi-fractals occur naturally in physical systems, one cannot simply
 dismiss such crazy eignevectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset 

 as unphysical: they are not only physical, but actually observed.

Distribution of the Rational numbers in the Farey tree
\layout Standard

One way to enumerate all of the rationals is by placing them on the Farey
 tree (or the Stern-Brocot tree).
 It can be shown that the Farey tree enumerates all of the rationals in
 the unit interval exactly once
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bog96}

\end_inset 

.
 However, the distribution of the rationals on the Farey tree is highly
 non-uniform, if the tree is walked breadth-first.
 The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Distribution-of-Farey}

\end_inset 

 shows that distribution.
 This distribution is highly non-uniform, and by fooling with the number
 of bins in the histogram, it becomes clear that the figure is highly discontinu
ous.
 As the number of bins is increased, it becomes clear that the distribution
 has a peculiar structure: it always has a humped form, even though the
 individual spikes vary strongly according to the number of bins.

Distribution of Farey Fractions
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics

	width 100col%

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows a histogram of the first M=65536 Farey fractions according
 to their location on the unit interval.
 To create this figure, the unit interval is divided up into N=600 bins,
 and the bin count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 for each bin 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is incremented whenever a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

 falls within the bin: 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)/N\leq p/q<n/N$
\end_inset 

.
 At the end of binning, the count is normalized by multiplying each bin
 count 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N/M$
\end_inset 

.
 The normalization ensures that the histogram is of measure one on the unit
 interval: that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{N}c_{n}=1$
\end_inset 

.
 In a certain sense, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

shape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of this histogram is independent of the number of bins and number of fractions
 counted, although on a highly detailed level, the graph clearly varies
 with the number of bins 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
 In a proper formal treatment, we would need to show that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 exists and is finite, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The shape is suggestive, and the numerical evidence makes it clear that
 it is somehow the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

derivative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of the Minkowski question mark function 
\begin_inset Formula $?'(x)=d?(x)/dx$
\end_inset 

.
 Performing a simple numeric integral of the above, and comparing it to
 the exact expression shows a perfect match, as witnessed in the figure

This figure shows the sum of the bin counts of the Farey fractions, together
 with a graph of the Minkowski question mark function.
 The two graphs can hardly be told apart.
 
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The derivative of the Minkowski question mark function cannot be defined
 using the classical analytic techniques.
 More precisely, traditional analytic tools applied to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 topology of open sets on the real number line are insufficient to construct
 and describe the shape of this curve.
 This motivates the study of alternative topologies for the real number
 line, which constitutes one of the research programs of this paper.
\layout Standard

When one does attempt to use classical techniques applied to the classical
 topology, the result is a number of perposterous-sounding statements, a
 sampling of which are given below.
 The question mark is highly singular.
 It is infinitely differentiable at every rational, and all derivatives
 vanish at every rational; yet the mapping is strictly monotonically increasing.
 Just examining the graph visually suggests that the derivatives must be
 non-zero 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, although how to define how to value these derivatives is utterly unclear.
 Naively, they seem to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at every irrational; but this fails to explain how to integrate.
 
\layout Standard

Clearly, the classical approach is sorely lacking and inapplicable; something
 different is needed.
 Two possibilities arise: throw away traditional ideas of integration and
 differentiation, and replace them with something new, something sutiable
 for fractals, or keep these tools, but throw away the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 topology on the real number line.
 The latter approach seems to be far more promising.
 There are several popssible alternative topologies.
 Most immediately obvious is the topology of the Cantor set, which is readily
 mapped to the real number line.
 (discussed elsewhere in this cycle of papers).
 Less obvious, but more appropriate, is the topology of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that is the natural topology for studying shifts, symbolic dynamics, and
 one-dimensional lattice models (discussed later).
\layout Standard

The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Jacobian}

\end_inset 

 shows what could be called the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $(?'\circ?^{-1})(x)$
\end_inset 

 of the question mark function.
 This figure simple relabels the x-axis by passing it through 
\begin_inset Formula $?(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 This function appears to vanish only at the dyadics.
 Note the superficial resemblance of the profile to the Takagi curve.
 By visually comparing this function and the Takagi curve (also called the
 
\emph on 
blancmange curve
\emph default 
), one can intuitively sense that there must be a more formal relation between
 the two, as if the values of the one function could somehow be exponentiated
 to give the other.
 The trick is to write down this relation.

\end_inset 

 which it resembles.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This is really a very curious circumstance.
 The above graphs show only the distribution of a finite number of points
 (they were, after all, computer generated).
 A finite set of points on the real number line is zero; yet we are using
 it to induce a measure that can be used for integration.
 How is this? The statistical properties of a finite sampling provide us
 with information about the limit.
 Its as if we were working with an anti-Cantor-set construction: we start
 with a dust, and average over intervals to discover analytic properties.

 The Takagi curve, explored in another chapter, is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

 The fractal symmetries of the Takagi curve are given by a three-dimensional
 representation of a sub semi-group of the modular group (see other chapter).
\end_inset 


\layout Subsection

Notes 
\layout Standard

Some slightly formal but not very fruitful remarks follow.
 To prove that the measure vanishes on rationals, one must show two things:
 first, that the measure vanishes near 0 (or 1), in that the the bin count
 for bin 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset 

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset 

 and a few neighbors) is always bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{-\alpha}$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset 

.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset 

 is probably quite large, and the bound can be made very strong.
 Next, one needs to show a modular group symmetry for the histogram: thus
 for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{pN/q}$
\end_inset 

 obeys a similar bound, but de-rated by a factor given by the modular group
 element that carries 
\begin_inset Formula $0/1$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset 

.

Spin lattice models
\layout Standard

In ergodic theory, there is a well-known set of isomorphisms and correspondences
 between one dimensional spin lattice models (such as the Ising model or
 Potts model), sub-shifts of finite type, and motion on hyperbolic surfaces.
 See, for example, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{May91}

\end_inset 

 for a review.
 This section reviews a small portion of this theory in a simplified manner,
 applying it in a concrete fashion to the question mark function.
\layout Standard

The importance of lattice models to the study of dynamical systems arises
 from the fact that the natural topology of the one-dimensional lattices,
 the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cylinder set topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is a refinement of the natural topology of the real number line.
 As such, it allows for the construction and consistent discussion of a
 much larger class of functions than the natural topology of the real number
 line allows.
 In particular, functions which are well-behaved in various ways (such as
 being smooth, or being symmetric) in the lattice topology are non-differentiabl
e and non-integrable when mapped to the real number line.
 Thus, the cylinder set topology allows for a natural setting for the discussion
 of objects that otherwise appear to be difficult to manipulate.
\layout Standard

Possibly the very simplest exactly solvable model of deterministic chaos
 is the Bernoulli map
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Dri99}

\end_inset 

.
 The Bernoulli map can be understood to be the (one-sided) shift operator
 on the set of (infinite) string strings in two letters.
 The Bernoulli map, like all discrete dynamical systems, can be studied
 in terms of its Frobenius-Perron operator or transfer operator.
 The transfer operator is a curious construction.
 Consider, for example, the set of all possible functions from the set of
 strings in two letters, to the real numbers.
 The transfer operator is then a representation of the the shift operator
 on this function space.
 That is, it describes what happens to the function when the underlying
 string is shifted by one.
 Transfer operators, being operators, may be decomposed in terms of eigenvalues
 and eigenvectors.
 Often one is interested in the polynomial or holomorphic eigenvectors.
 One may also study the square-integrable eigenvectors.
 Sometimes, the polynomial eigenvectors are a subset of the square-integrable
 eigenvectors, sometimes not.
 The transfer operator may be unitary in one function basis, but not in
 another; it need not in general be either a compact operator or a trace-class
 operator.
 
\layout Standard

If one considers a one-dimensional lattice where each lattice location can
 take one of two values, then the Bernoulli operator is nothing more and
 nothing less than the shift or translation operator on this lattice.
 Lattice models provide a very natural way to construct translation-invariant
 functions on them.
 But of course (and as will be shown), a translation-invariant function
 on a lattice is nothing more and nothing less than an eigenvector of the
 transfer operator, with an eigenvalue of one: indeed this is the definition
 of translation invariance.
 The set of translation-invariant functions on a one-dimensional lattice
 is much, much larger than the set of square integrable eigenvectors of
 the transfer operator, which is in turn much larger than the set of polynomial
 (or holomorphic) eigenvectors of this operator.
 Thus, the study of lattice models provides a broader context for the discussion
 of dynamical systems, and the lattice model topology allows for the discussion
 and manipulation of functions (such as the derivative of the Minkowski
 function) that are not otherwise easy to manipulate.
 
\layout Standard

The Bernoulli map is a one-sided shift operator, and it does not have a
 time-reversible dynamics.
 It corresponds to the shift operator on a lattice with extends only in
 one direction.
 The baker's map provides a simple, solvable time-reversible chaotic dynamical
 system.
 The baker's map corresponds to a bi-infinite one-dimensional lattice, where
 the shift can be made to the right or to the left.
 The connection to the Ising model is, in one sense, shallow: the Ising
 model just happens to show how to construct translation-invariant functions
 on a lattice, and thus construct eigenvectors (with unit eigenvalue) of
 the transfer operator.
 In another sense, the connection is much deeper: by understanding the cylinder
 set topology, and the fractal self-similarities that it generates, one
 may gain a better understanding of the structure of functional integrals
 in quantum field theory.
 The ideas are not disjoint: rather the methods and theorems from one field
 of study can be imported to better understand the other.

Overview
\layout Standard

Consider the one-dimensional, two-state lattice model, with the lattice
 having a countable infinity of lattice positions.
 The set of all possible states of the lattice is the set of all possible
 (infinitely-long) strings in two letters.
 This set of strings is a very large set: it has 
\begin_inset Formula $\aleph_{1}=2^{\omega}$
\end_inset 

 elements in the set.
 The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum.
 The (classical) Hamiltonian is a function that assigns a real value to
 each possible element of this set.
 The Hamiltonian is not the only physically interesting function; in physics,
 one may also be interested in the partition function, the mean magnetization,
 ore correlation functions.
 In mathematics, there are yet more interesting aspects.
\layout Standard

When discussing such lattice models, a problem arises: how should one label
 the points in this set? Each corresponds to an infinite string in two letters.
 This set is not enumerable, so one cannot label them with integers.
 Operations with respect to the label, such as summation or integration,
 are potentially troublesome.
 Summation requires a countable label; summation is defined only on countable
 sets.
 The analog of summation for uncountable sets is integration; however, integrati
on cannot be simply or naively defined on uncountable point-sets, and requires
 the framework of measure theory to be mathematically rigorous.

The following sections will develop the two-state one-dimensional lattice
 model, primarily with the goal of elucidating the structure of Minkowski's
 question mark function.
 It is important to realize that lattice models can be generalized in a
 large variety of ways, and many of these generalizations have important
 implicaitons for physics, and are mathematically interesting for a large
 variety of reasons.
 Almost none of these generalizations or connections are mentioned below;
 they can be found in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{May91}

\end_inset 

.
 The focus here really is intended to be the question mark function.
 
\layout Standard

The discussion will explore several directions, focusing on the natural
 topology of one-dimensional lattice models, and relating that topology
 to the Cantor set, and the natural topology on the real numbers.
 The full exposition requires the application of measure theory and sigma
 algrebras to the one-dimensional lattice models; these ideas are presented
 here as simply as possible, assuming little prior acquaintance.
 One can also gain considerable intuition by sticking to naive point-set
 topology, that is, by working with a lattice of finite size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 and imagining the possibility of taking the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The finite-sized lattice provides a simple, concrete system for discussion,
 and is thus presented first, in the following section.
 
\layout Subsection

Naive lattice theory
\layout Standard

The naive approach to lattice theory is to work with a finite-sized lattice,
 one with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 lattice points, and then attempt to perform the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 limit.
 In the following, we work with a one-dimensional, two-state lattice model,
 where the two states are alternately denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $L,R$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-1,+1$
\end_inset 

, as suitable for the given context.
 
\layout Standard

Given a lattice of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 sites, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset 

 different possible lattice configurations, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset 

 different possible strings in two letters.
 One defines an interaction potential between neighboring spins in the lattice.
 For the traditional Ising model, the interaction potential is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(\sigma)=J\sigma_{0}\sigma_{1}+M\sigma_{0}\label{eq:Ising potential}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)\in2^{N}$
\end_inset 

 is one possible configuration, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}\in\{-1,+1\}$
\end_inset 

 is the spin at lattice location 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

.
 The Ising potential consists of a nearest-neighbor interaction, with energy
 
\begin_inset Formula $J\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 and the interaction of the spin with an external magnetic field 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

.
 The physical interpretation of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

spin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

magnetic field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or even 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is not important for the development here; these are merely the terms used
 by physicists to label these quantities.
 
\layout Standard

The total energy of a given lattice configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H(\sigma)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}V(\tau^{k}\sigma)\label{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is the shift operator: 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\ldots)$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, one takes the interaction potential to be translation invariant,
 and so sums over all nearest-neighbor interactions.
 In fact, the class of translation invariant interactions can be shown to
 be isomorphic to a certain class of measure-preserving dynamical systems,
 again, see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{May91}

\end_inset 

 for details.
 The above summation glosses over boundary conditions, that is, it ignores
 what happens when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N$
\end_inset 

.
 This gloss can be hand-waved away by arguing that it makes no difference
 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

limit.
 Similarly, the lattice is considered to extend only to the right, 
\emph on 
i.e.

\emph default 
 to exist for non-negative 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

 values only; this is another gloss that makes little practical difference,
 and is useful to keep notation simple and unburdened.

This figure shows the energy of various configurations of the Ising model.
 A lattice with ten lattice points is considered, so the total number of
 possible lattice states is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{10}=1024$
\end_inset

 The energy of each of these possible lattice configurations is shown in

Quantities, such as the energy, may be readily graphed by identifying lattice
 locations with bit positions in the bit-string representation of a dyadic
 rational.
 That is, one represents the lattice configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

with the rational 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\sigma)$
\end_inset 

 given by
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x(\sigma)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}\left(\frac{\sigma_{k}+1}{2}\right)2^{-(k+1)}=\sum_{k=0}^{N}b_{k}2^{-(k+1)}\label{eq:dyadic map}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset 

 is the lattice configuration at the

 A graph of the energy, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

, is shown in the figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Ising-Model-Configuration}

\end_inset

 An obvious fractal-like shape is readily visible, and it is straight-forward
 to give an explicit representation of the action of the dyadic monoid on
 this fractal curve.
 This is given in a later section.
\layout Standard

An important idea in statistical mechanics is not only the energy of each
 configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

, but also a probability or likely-hood that it occurs in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

canonical ensemble
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of all possible configurations.
 The probability is usually given by the Boltzmann distribution 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P(\sigma)=\frac{1}{Z(\Omega)}\;\exp\left(-\frac{H(\sigma)}{k_{B}T}\right)\label{eq:probability distribution}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset 

 is interpreted as the temperature and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}$
\end_inset 

 is Boltzmann's constant.
 For this discussion, the physical interpretation of these values is not
 particularly important; what is important is that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\sigma)$
\end_inset 

 can be interpreted as a probability (more precisely, a 
\emph on 
probability density function
\emph default 
): it is non-negative, and with an appropriate normalization factor 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(\Omega)$
\end_inset 

, it sums to one.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=2^{N}=\{\sigma\}$
\end_inset 

 is used to denote the set of all possible configurations.
 A graph of this probability function for the Ising model is shown in figure
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Ising-Model-Configuration}

\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

At least a superficial resemblance of the probability to the distribution
 of the Farey numbers of figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Distribution-of-Farey}

\end_inset 

 is readily apparent.
 This resemblance can be emphasized by graphing the the cumulative distribution
 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\sigma)$
\end_inset 

, that is, graphing
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(y)=\sum_{\sigma;x(\sigma)<y}P(x)\label{eq:cumulative distribution}\end{equation}

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Ising potential}

 As in the other graphs, the lattice size is taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}=1024$

 states are graphed.
 The Ising interaction is taken with 
\begin_inset Formula $J=0.3$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M=0$
\end_inset 

.
 The cumulative distribution is fractal, and its fractal self-similarity
 can be given a precise expression.
 For comparison, the question mark function is also graphed.
 Although the shapes are clearly different, none-the-less, this begs the
 question: is there some interaction potential that can result in a perfect
 match?
\end_inset 


\layout Subsubsection

Fractal self-symmetry
\layout Standard

In this section, we want to give explicit expression to the apparent fractal
 self-similarity seen in the Ising model.
 To simplify the discussion, this section assumes the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

, or at least that 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 is indeterminate when the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 limit is ambiguous or ill-defined.
 As before, the lattice is assumed to be one-sided: that is, it starts at
 0 and stretches off to the right, so that lattice positions can be labelled
 by non-negative integers.
 The two-sided lattice is treated in a later section; while there are many
 similarities, there are also important differences between the one-sided
 and the two sided lattice.
\layout Standard

Consider the behavior of the classical Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

 under the right shift of the lattice, with a new spin 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 introduced to occupy the zeroth position.
 One then has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H(s,\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)=V(s,\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)+H(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Taking 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset 

 and using the dyadic mapping 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dyadic map}

\end_inset 

, the above may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=V\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+H\left(x\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=+1$
\end_inset 

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\frac{1+x}{2}\right)=V\left(\frac{1+x}{2}\right)+H\left(x\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For the probability distribution, one has (after taking 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}=T=1$
\end_inset 

) 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=e^{-V(x/2)}P\left(x\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so on.
 As any true self-similarity, this can be iterated repeatedly, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=P(x)\;\prod_{k=1}^{n}e^{-V(x/2^{k})}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For the Ising potential 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Ising potential}

\end_inset 

, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x)$
\end_inset 

 takes a particularly simple form: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V_{\mbox{Ising}}(x)=\begin{cases}
J-M & \quad\mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{4}\\
-J-M & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{4}\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
-J+M & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x<\frac{3}{4}\\
J+M & \quad\mbox{ for }\frac{3}{4}\le x\le1\end{cases}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so the probability distribution has a simple scaling:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P_{\mbox{Ising}}\left(\frac{x}{2^{n}}\right)=\lambda^{n}P_{\mbox{Ising}}(x)\qquad\mbox{for }0\le x\le\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\exp(M-J)$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Another natural symmetry operation of the lattice is the exchange of spin
 values 
\begin_inset Formula $+\sigma_{k}\leftrightarrow-\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset 

.
 For the dyadic mapping, this corresponds to the exchange 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leftrightarrow1-x$
\end_inset 

.
 Let the exchange of spin values be denoted by the operation 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 (for 
\emph on 
reflection
\emph default 
); the dyadic representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 is the function 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}(x)=1-x$
\end_inset 

.
 Let the right shift operation, with an insertion of a spin of -1 at the
 zeroth lattice position be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

.
 The dyadic representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}(x)=x/2$
\end_inset 

.
 The operations 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

, taken as a free monoid (that is a free group, but with non-negative powers
 only) generate the dyadic monoid.
 A synopsis of the properties of this monoid are given below, after which
 the analysis of self-similarity resumes.
\layout Subsubsection

The dyadic monoid
\layout Standard

Given operations 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 acting as representations of translation and reflection, one has in essence
 constructed everything that is needed to have a fractal with dyadic symmetry.
 That is, one need only to recognize that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 generate the dyadic monoid of the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 The elements of this monoid are of the form
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma=g^{a}rg^{b}rg^{c}\cdots\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,\ldots$
\end_inset 

 are non-negative integers.
 This section provides a very brief synopsis of the general properties of
 monoid elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

; these properties are presented in greater detail in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ve-M04,Ve-T04}

\end_inset 

.
 First, all such elements may be represented by the continued fraction
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{C}=\frac{1}{a+\frac{1}{b+\frac{1}{c+\cdots}}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Since every real number has an (essentially) unique representation in terms
 of continued fractions (up to a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset 

choice), this means the self-symmetries of the fractal may be labelled by
 the real numbers.
 The generators 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 also generate walks on the infinite binary tree: 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 may be taken to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

always take the left branch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 may be taken to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

reverse the sense of left and right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Walks on the binary tree may also be represented as a sequence of left,
 right moves.
 An arbitrary string in two letters 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset 

 and R may be taken to be a real number as well, which may be denoted by
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset 

 when the sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $L,R$
\end_inset 

 moves take one to the same place as the series of 
\begin_inset Formula $g,r$
\end_inset 

 moves given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, one has the representation as a binary fraction
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{D}=\begin{array}{ccccc}
0.\underbrace{000...0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0} & \underbrace{11..1} & \underbrace{00..0}1..\\
a-1 & b & c & d & e\end{array}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The Minkowski question mark function is nothing more and nothing less than
 the function that relates 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{D}$
\end_inset 

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?(\gamma_{C})=\gamma_{D}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 In terms of the generators, on has 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-r(1-x)$
\end_inset 

, which is satisfied by the question mark: 
\begin_inset Formula $(?\circ r)(x)=?(1-x)=1-?(x)=(r\circ?)(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 The generator 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 has inequivalent representations 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset 

and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{C}$
\end_inset 

 for the dyadic and continued fraction representations, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}(x)=x/2$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{C}(x)=x/(x+1)$
\end_inset 

, so that one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(g_{D}\circ?\right)(x)=\frac{?(x)}{2}=?\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right)=\left(?\circ g_{C}\right)(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 To summarize, a general monoid element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a}rg^{b}rg^{c}\cdots$
\end_inset 

 has two inequivalent representations as a real number.
 
\layout Standard

Another important property is that both 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{D}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{C}$
\end_inset 

 can also be understood to be maps from the unit interval to a specific
 subinterval.
 This, for example,
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{D}(x)=(g_{D}^{a_{1}}r_{D}g_{D}^{a_{2}}r_{D}...r_{D}g_{D}^{a_{N}})(x)=\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}}}-\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}}}+\frac{1}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}}}-...+(-)^{N+1}\frac{x}{2^{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+...+a_{N}}}\label{eq:interval map}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 maps the unit interval into a dyadic sub-interval.
 Use of continued fractions gives another, different interval map for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{C}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsubsection

Self-similarity again
\layout Standard

Returning to the self-symmetries of the classical lattice models, one can
 write transformation properties of the probability distribution as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(P\circ g_{D}\right)(x)=P\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=e^{-V(x/2)}P\left(x\right)=e^{-\left(V\circ g_{D}\right)(x)}P(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(P\circ r\right)(x)=P\left(1-x\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 One may now ask for, and provide, the self-similarity transformation that
 corresponds to the interval map 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:interval map}

\end_inset 

.
 The iterated application of the above two equations then provides a formula
 that relates the probability distribution on a sub-interval to the probability
 distribution on the entire interval.
\layout Standard

The simpler case, treated first, occurs when the potential is symmetric
 under the exchange of 
\begin_inset Formula $+\sigma_{k}\leftrightarrow-\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset 

; that is, when 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x)=V(1-x)$
\end_inset 

.
 One may then easily show that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)=P(1-x)$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Consider, for example, the interval given by 
\begin_inset Formula $grg^{3}(x)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{8}$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, repeatedly applying the above, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
P\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{8}\right) & = & P\left(grg^{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & e^{-V(grg^{3})}P\left(rg^{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & e^{-V(grg^{3})}P\left(g^{3}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & e^{-V(grg^{3})}e^{-V(g^{3})}e^{-V(g^{2})}e^{-V(g)}P\left(x\right)\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 where the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 was dropped to keep the notation simple.
 This formula relates in a precise (and computable) way the probability
 distribution on a subinterval to the whole interval.
 The process can be repeated to obtain a relation joining any dyadic subinterval
 to the whole interval.
 
\layout Standard

For potentials that are not symmetric, the development has some additional
 complications.
 Write the potential as in terms of even and odd parts 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x)=V_{e}(x)+V_{o}(x)$
\end_inset 

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{e}(x)=V_{e}(1-x)$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{o}(x)=-V_{o}(1-x)$
\end_inset 

.
 It follows from equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

 that the energy can be decomposed in the same way.
 The probability is multiplicative, so one has 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)=P_{e}(x)P_{o}(x)$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}(x)=\exp(-H_{e}(x))$
\end_inset 

 and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{o}$
\end_inset 

.
 Under inversion , one then has 
\begin_inset Formula $P(1-x)=P_{e}(x)/P_{o}(x)$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The point here is that the probability distribution has a self-similar structure

The Ising model interaction potential has the general form

The graph

 gives a cumulative probability distribution that is exactly the question

 There is not just one, but several interactions that give such a cumulative

 The other is hinted at numerically, under the name of the Kac model, given

Suppose one wants to have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P(x)=\left(?^{\prime}\circ?^{-1}\right)(x)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 exactly.
 One may then work backwards to find the potential, as follows.
 One must have 
\begin_inset Formula $P(?(x))=?^{\prime}(x)$
\end_inset 

, and, applying the symmetries of the question mark function,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{?(x)}{2}=?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:question-self}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

one has simply that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=P\left(?\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\right)=?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Applying the symmetry of the lattice model under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 as discussed above, one gets an expression involving the potential 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)=\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)P\left(?(x)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 from which one deduces 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)=?^{\prime}(x)\;\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 On the other hand, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{?^{\prime}(x)}{2}=\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}?^{\prime}\left(\frac{x}{1+x}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which may be obtained by naively differentiating the relation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:question-self}

 From this one deduces that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{(1+x)^{2}}{2}=\exp\left(-V\left(\frac{?(x)}{2}\right)\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

It is not clear how to write this interaction function as sum of interactions
 between lattice spins, and that makes this function less appealing from
 a physical viewpoint.
 One may learn something about the dyadic mapping by attempting to express
 this function as a set of spin interactions.
 XXX do this exercise.
 A different potential, the Kac model, discussed below, has a simple pair-wise
 interaction between spins, falling off geometrically as the distance.
 The Kac model also seems to converge to the same probability distribution,
 although it clearly is a very different interaction.

\layout Standard

The description of the Kac model is similar to that for the Ising model,
 with the exception that the interaction potential is not limited to a nearest
 neighbor interaction, but instead extends between distant sites, with a
 geometrically decreasing strength.
 That is, the potential is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
V(\sigma)=-J(1-\lambda)\,\sigma_{0}\,\sum_{k=1}^{N}\sigma_{k}\lambda^{k}\label{eq:Kac potential}\end{equation}

 In physics, this normalization is known as the

partition function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: it is a function of not only the temperature (which we have taken as one)
 but also of the various constants appearing in the interaction potential,
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsubsection

Physical interpretation
\layout Standard

A physical interpretation can be given to the appearance of the question
 mark function.
 In the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, any lattice configurations with long runs of repeated spins will have
 a very large energy (when 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset 

 is taken positive), and thus the exponential give such cases an exponentially
 small probability.
 In the dyadic mapping, long runs of repeated spins correspond to dyadic
 rationals: that is, numbers whose first few bits may vary, but whose binary
 expansion eventually terminates.
 Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset 

 has the binary expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $0.10000\ldots$
\end_inset 

 and the long string of zeros leads to a large energy and a small probability;
 in the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 this becomes an infinite energy and a zero probability.
 This effect can be clearly seen in the graphs.
 Of course, strings such as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.100\ldots001$
\end_inset 

 are also disfavored; in the dyadic mapping, such strings are located 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

near
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset 

, and account for the pronounced dip in that area.
 Similarly, strings near zero and one begin with (rather than end with)
 long runs of zeros and ones, and are also seen to be dis-favored.
 (There is a possibility in principle, which does not occur here, of Anderson
 localized states, which are states having only a finite extent but still
 having finite energy.
 Viewed as a subshift of finite type, localized states would be identified
 with instantons.
 The point is that the binary expansion for 1/2 need not have an 
\emph on 
a priori
\emph default 
 probability of zero.)
\layout Standard

Now, the question mark function maps the rational numbers to the dyadic
 rationals; in the Kac model, the dyadic rationals have a zero thermodynamic
 probability.
 In this sense, we may understand why the derivative of the question mark
 function is necessarily zero at all rationals.
 Conversely, one may see that the derivative of the question mark function
 is necessarily non-zero in those places where the strings of letter alternate,
 ad infinitum.
 A special case of alternating strings are periodic strings: strings that
 may begin with some random pattern, but eventually settle down to a periodic
 pattern.
 Periodic strings are interesting because their energy can be precisely
 computed even in the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
 Periodic binary strings correspond to those rationals that are not dyadic;
 for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $2/3=0.10101\ldots$
\end_inset 

 These are the only such periodic strings, as there are no irrationals that
 have a periodic binary expansion.
 For the question mark function, periodic strings also have a significance:
 they correspond to the quadratic irrationals.
 This result was noted hundreds of years ago (by Gauss??), in the study
 of Diophantine equations: the solutions to the Diophantine equations are
 the quadratic irrationals, which may be specified as continued fractions
 with a periodic component in the continued fraction.
 The question mark function maps such periodic continued fractions to periodic
 binary strings: thus the quadratic irrationals and the rational numbers
 are in perfect one-to-one correspondence.

The two-sided lattice

The two-sided lattice is the lattice that stretches off to both the left
 and the right.
 The state of the two-sided lattice may be represented by two numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x,y\le1$

\begin_inset Formula $x$

\end_inset 

 likewise, but instead being a sum over the negative indexes, starting at
 
\begin_inset Formula $k=-1$
\end_inset

 The energy is a simple sum of the energy of the half-lattices to the left
 and to the right, plus an interaction term involving spins on both the
 left and right.
 The probability density is a product of the probability densities on the
 left and right, adjusted by the interaction between the left and right
 sides.

The shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 can be understood to be an operator that pops a bit off the right-hand
 half lattice, and pushes it onto the left half-lattice.
 In the dyadic notation, it can be recognized as the so-called 
\emph on 
Baker's map
\emph default 
, a map from the unit square onto itself that cuts the square into two pieces,
 and stacks and squashes them.
 That is, given a pair of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset 

 in the unit square, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tau(x,y)=\left(\frac{x+\left\lfloor 2y\right\rfloor }{2}\,,\,2y-\left\lfloor 2y\right\rfloor \right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The Baker's map can be studied in its own right as a discrete-time dynamical
 system, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 can be taken to define the time evolution of a unit square over a single
 time-step.
 The time evolution is invertible, in that the inverse map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 is uniquely defined, being 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tau^{-1}(x,y)=\left(2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \,,\,\frac{y+\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor }{2}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The inverse map can be seen to be identical to the forward map with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

 interchanged: that is, translation to the left on the lattice is identical
 to translation to the right, with left and right exchanged.
 One may say the map is 
\begin_inset Formula $PT$
\end_inset 

-symmetric, with 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset 

 standing for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The two-sided lattice may be studied either as a lattice model, or as a
 dynamical system with time evolutino given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 It is interesting to juxtapose these two viewpoints.
 As a lattice model, one is typically only interested in lattices for which
 the energy and the probability density are invariant under the action of
 the translation operator.
 That is, one is interested only in the classical Hamiltonians of eqn 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

 which are translation-invariant: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(\tau^{n}\sigma\right)=H\left(\sigma\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Considered as a dynamical system, one is typically interested in the time
 evolution of densities on the unit square, that is, of real-valued maps
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

.
 The time evolution of a density can be simply understood as a physical
 model, where the density is a local density of some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of points 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset 

, with the time evolution of each point given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, the time evolution of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or density is given by the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}\rho\right](x,y)=\left(\rho\circ\tau^{-1}\right)(x,y)=\rho\left(2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \,,\,\frac{y+\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor }{2}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The transfer operator is thus a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset 

 is the set of functions on the unit square.
 Clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 is a linear operator.
 One is interested in characterizing the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

.
 The general idea behind equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

 can be immediately appealed to, to construct some of the eigenstates of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, on considers functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset 

 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\lambda^{k}g\circ\tau^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 given some function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,y)$
\end_inset 

 and number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

.
 Formally, such an 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 is an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset 

.
 In practial terms, it is evident that not all possible 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 can make the sum convergent, although one might expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset 

 on the unit circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|=1$
\end_inset 

 of the complex plane might lead to a convergent sum.
 Thus immediately, one deduces that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 must surely be a unitary operator.
 The unitarity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset 

 makes intuitive sense in a certain way: the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is invertible, and one expects time-reversible evolution to be described
 by unitary operators.

 the irrationals: only the irrationals are mapped to strings that don't
 terminate.
 In physics, such states are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Gibbs states
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: they are the states that are associated with a finite thermodynamic energy.
 From the above presentation, we can deduce that the Gibbs states are in
 some sense 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the space of all configurations; conversely, so are the non-Gibbs states.
 A rigorous notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, however, requires a topology; a topology for the lattice models is constructed
 in a later section.
\layout Standard

The Gibbs states may also be used to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

explain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 the fractal self-similarity of the question mark function.
 Both the Ising and the Kac potentials are translationally invariant, in
 that the total energy does not change as the shift operator is applied
 to the lattice.
 The translation invariance is an explicit part of the construction: it
 is used in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Classical Hamiltonian}

\end_inset 

 to construct the total energy.
 In a certain sense, the Gibbs states are precisely those states that are
 translationally invariant.
 That is, if one chooses some Gibbs state, and then chops off the leading
 binary digit, one must necessarily have another Gibbs state.
 
\layout Standard

At first blush, the matching of real numbers to lattice model configurations
 given by the dyadic map of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dyadic map}

\end_inset 

 may seem arbitrary: one might imagine a large class of maps that could
 connect these spaces.
 The seeming fractal nature of the problem may be a trick of the mind, wrapped
 up in the mapping of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dyadic map}

\end_inset 

 instead of being intrinsic to the physics of the configuration space.
 This concern raises two important questions: does there exist a non-fractal
 mapping from the space of configuration states to the real number line,
 and how should the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fractal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 be expressed on spaces, such as the space of states, whose topology is
 not naturally that of the real number line?
\layout Standard

A reasonable requirement on a map from the configuration space to the reals
 would be that it somehow preserves the translation invariance.
 Translation invariance is an important physical requirement for a lattice
 model, and one would like to have this requirement reflected in the mapping.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 is some map that assigns a real number to each point 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in\Omega$
\end_inset 

, the set of all possible states, then one might require that there exists
 a non-trivial function 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(f\circ\tau)(\sigma)=(g\circ f)(\sigma)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

is the shift operator.
 This requirement that the mapping preserve translation invariance is simply
 a requirement that there exists a commuting diagram:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\Omega & {{f\atop \longrightarrow}} & \mathbb{R}\\
\tau\downarrow &  & \downarrow g\\
\Omega & {{\longrightarrow\atop f}} & \mathbb{R}\end{array}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 It should now be clear that the representation of translation invariance
 on the real number line is a requirement that the mapping have a fixed
 point at which it is self-similar: that is, one must have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(f\circ\tau^{n})(\sigma)=(g^{n}\circ f)(\sigma)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for all positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 Translation invariance implies iteration; it is well understood that, in
 general, the iteration of functions of the real number line results in
 fractals.
 The above result is general; it applies to all one-dimensional lattice
 models, and is not dependent one the form of the interaction, or even on
 the number of states at a given lattice location.
\layout Standard

For the two-state model, there is another symmetry that one might expect
 to preserve: this is the symmetry under the interchange of the two states.
 In the absence of a magnetic-field-type interaction (so 
\begin_inset Formula $M=0$
\end_inset 

 in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Ising potential}

\end_inset 

), one might expect an absolute symmetry.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:\Omega\to\Omega$
\end_inset 

 be this reflection operator, the operator that, given a string of letters
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

, exchanges letter 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset 

 (or state -1) for the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset 

 (or state +1), and 
\emph on 
vice-versa
\emph default 
.
 Corresponding to this, one expects a function 
\begin_inset Formula $r:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset 

 that makes the following diagram commute: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\Omega & {{f\atop \longrightarrow}} & \mathbb{R}\\
\rho\downarrow &  & \downarrow r\\
\Omega & {{\longrightarrow\atop f}} & \mathbb{R}\end{array}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{2}(\sigma)=\sigma$
\end_inset 

 the identity function, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}(x)=x$
\end_inset 

 is the identity as well.
 
\layout Standard

Given such a translation-invariant homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

, that has functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 acting as representations of translation and reflection, one has in essence
 constructed everything that is needed to have a fractal with dyadic symmetry.
 That is, one need only to recognize that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 generate the dyadic monoid of the modular group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 The elements of this monoid are of the form
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma=g^{a}\circ r\circ g^{b}\circ r\circ g^{c}\circ\cdots\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,\ldots$
\end_inset 

 are non-negative integers.
 
\layout Standard

Thus, we have demonstrated a corollary, of sorts: no matter what the form
 of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

, if it preserves the translation invariance of the lattice, then the Minkowski
 question mark will inevitably appear in the theory.
\layout Standard

This construction holds for essentially all two-state lattice models.
 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 be the translation-invariant homomorphism as above, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $h:\Omega\to X$
\end_inset 

 be just about any function to some space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 which commutes with the reflection operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $(h\circ f^{-1}):\mathbb{R}\to X$
\end_inset 

 is necessarily a fractal, having elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset 

 of the dyadic monoid giving the set of self-symmetries of the fractal.
 (The details on why anything having dyadic monoid symmetry is a fractal
 are voluminously and excruciatingly detailed in my other writings).
 In particular, the result here is independent of the details of the interaction
 between spins (barring the magnetic interaction, which can also be taken
 care of).
 We conclude:

Free monoids and the self-symmetries of lattices
\layout Standard

The set of strings generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $g,r$
\end_inset 

 is the free monoid 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset 

, the monoid analog of a free group.
 The notation here is that the exponent on 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset 

 is any element of the natural numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset 

 indicates that exponent on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset 

 is 0 or 1 because 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}=e$
\end_inset 

.
 The Cayley graph of this monoid is the infinite binary tree, and, as mentioned
 above, it is shared by the monoid 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 when interpreted as sequences of left-right moves walking the tree.
 That is, the monoid generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset 

 is the set of all strings in two letters.
\layout Standard

It should be clear from the above construction that the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset 

-state lattice model, of which the Potts model is an example, would have
 a set of symmetries that are the free monoid of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z}_{K}$
\end_inset 

.
 (Properly, the symmetries are isometries, although the 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset 

-adic metric has not yet been defined here.) The point here is that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ordinary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Euclidean translations are not the only symmetries that occur naturally
 in the studies of lattice models.
 
\layout Standard

Now, in general, when some function on a topological space has some self-resembl
ance after some action, one says that this function is self-similar.
 When there are a countable number of such self-resemblances, one might
 say that the function is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

translationally invariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, or so, or show that a fixed point results.
 When the number of such self-resemblances is dense in some way, or tends
 to the uncountable, or is characterized by a free group or free monoid,
 one says the function is a fractal.
 This motivates the following definition of a fractal:
\layout Description

Definition Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset 

 be topological spaces, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f:X\to Y$
\end_inset 

 be some map between them.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:X\to X$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau:X\to X$
\end_inset 

 be two isomorphisms of the spaces.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 is said to preserves these isomorphisms, if there exist maps 
\begin_inset Formula $r:Y\to Y$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g:Y\to Y$
\end_inset 

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\circ\rho=r\circ f$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\circ\tau=g\circ f$
\end_inset 

.
 If such an 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 exists, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 together generate some free monid, then we say that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset 

 has the 
\series bold 
\emph on 
structure of a fractal
\series default 
\emph default 
.
\layout Standard

This definition seems almost silly, because after a bit of reflection, one
 realizes that there are many, many systems in physics and mathematics that
 would have the structure of a fractal according to this definition.
 For example, every Lie group has a discrete lattice that acts freely on
 the Lie group, and thus one may find maps that have the structure of a
 fractal.
 On the other hand, this is perhaps not unexpected: the Anosov flow on the
 tangent space of a Lie group typically has expanding and contracting directions
, making the tangent manifold hyperbolic, and the flow ergodic.
 Ergodicity is typically associated with fractal behaviour, and hyperbolic
 structures typically admit ergodic flows, and so the above definition of
 a fractal structure is perhaps not ludicrous.
 
\layout Standard

The requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 generate some free monoid can be loosened to a monoid with a presentation,
 as long as the monoid is hyperbolic.
 Clearly, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 had a presentation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\tau=\tau\rho$
\end_inset 

 then the generated monoid would be flat Euclidean space, which is clearly
 not fractal.

Measure Theory
\layout Standard

ToDo This is what needs to be done for the following sections.
\layout Standard

Several questions arise.
 First, can the relation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cumulative}

\end_inset 

 be formally derived? Can the left-hand side of this equation be given a
 precise meaning? A strict derivation should provide a topology on the configura
tion space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset 

 in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

, and then clarify how the topology of that space maps to the natural topology
 of the real numbers, as well as its relationship to the topology of the
 Cantor set.
 In particular, the derivation should make clear what aspects of the fractal
 behavior can be attributed to the mapping of the topologies, and what aspects
 depend on the choice of some particular translation-invariant long-range
 interaction.
\layout Standard

Notable is the appearance and importance of the exponential function.
 In the normal study of number theory, rationals, modular forms, the question
 mark function, and the like, the exponential function makes almost no appearanc
e ever.
 Thus, it's appearance here should be more than just curious; it begs for
 a deeper explanation.
 
\layout Standard

It may be immediately intuited that this function gives a preferential weight
 to configurations with aligned spins, but why this was not inherently incorpora
ted into the Hamiltonian deserves a review.
 
\layout Standard

The next section begins a more formal development, starting with a a review
 of a topology for lattice models, and the sigma algebra that may be built
 on it.
\layout Subsubsection

Measure theory and sigma-algebras on a lattice 
\layout Standard

From the above discussion, it is clear that taking the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 limit of a one-dimensional lattice model will require a way to promote
 the sums over configuration space into integrals.
 As pointed out in the introduction, this is not a trivial matter, because
 the cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{N}$
\end_inset 

 of the configuration space changes from finite to uncountable in the limit.
 In particular, it is known from measure theory that it is impossible to
 define integration on a point set with the cardinality of the continuum.
 To properly define integration, one must define a topology and a sigma-algebra
 first.
 A general presentation of this idea is given here.
\layout Standard

The machinery of measure theory forces a radical shift in the language,
 notation and concepts used to discuss the problem.
 First of all, one can no longer employ the idea that the space consists
 of a set of points.
 There is a reason for this: not every subset of of an uncountably-infinite
 set is "measurable".
 In fact, almost all subsets of an uncountably-infinite set are not measurable.
 So the very first step of measure theory is to throw away almost all subsets
 of the total space.
 One keeps only the measurable sets.
 The collection of measurable sets is countable, and to each such set one
 assigns a (non-negative) size or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This collection forms a topology, in the sense that the intersection or
 union of any two measurable sets is also a measurable set, and has a size.
 Such a collection of sets, equipped with a size, and obeying an additional
 axiom, (that of sigma-additivity, to be defined), is called a sigma algebra.
 
\layout Standard

In this new language, the Hamiltonian takes on a new and very different
 appearance.
 It is no longer a function from points to the reals, but a function from
 elements of the sigma algebra to the reals.
 Intuitively, this "new" Hamilton can be visualized or intuited as the "average"
 of the old, classical Hamiltonian, the average taken over a certain subset
 of points.
 However, this intuition is dangerous, and can lead to errors: in particular,
 one has the chicken-and-egg problem of how to define the "average" of the
 old, classical Hamiltonian.
 The new Hamiltonian is different, and cannot be constructed from the old
 Hamiltonian.
 However, there is a way to prove that the new Hamiltonian is a faithful
 representation of the old one.
 If one has chosen one's sigma algebra wisely, then for every possible point
 in the old set, there is a sequence or filter or net of elements of the
 sigma algebra that contain the old point, and the measure of the elements
 in this sequence decreases to zero.
 
\layout Standard

Suppose that the elements of this net are denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, and have a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(a_{n})$
\end_inset 

 The net is ordered so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(a_{n})<\mu(a_{k})$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $n>k$
\end_inset 

.
 The "new" Hamiltonian is some function that assigns a real value to each
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 We can then say that the new and the old Hamiltonians are equal or equivalent
 when, for the "classical" point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, the following are satisfied: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p\in a_{n}\quad\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}\]

\end_inset 

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(a_{n})=0\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{H(a_{n})}{\mu(a_{n})}=E_{p}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{p}$
\end_inset 

 is the classical energy of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 which the net is converging to.
 Again: to be clear: the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 is a possible configuration of the lattice model; each and every point
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

 corresponds to an infinite string in two letters, and vice-versa, in one-to-one
 correspondence.
 If a net can be found for all points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, and the above relationship holds for all points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, and it holds for all possible nets to the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

, then one may honestly and truthfully insists that the "new" and the "old"
 Hamiltonians "are the same".
\layout Standard

More generally, this sort of a measure-theoretic reformulation of integration
 over an uncountable set of points is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

second quantization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in physics, and the integration is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

functional integration
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 A word of caution: standard treatments of second quantization in physics
 texts do not follow the above construction.
 This approach only becomes apparent in mathematical treatments of second
 quantization (need ref), where the aim is to construct a topological space
 over which integration can be performed.
 In the following, the

The cylinder set topology
\layout Standard

The natural topology for the configuration space of one-dimensional lattice
 models has a sub-base that consists of cylinder sets.
 It is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the sense that there is a simple and natural action of the shift operator
 on the cylinder sets, and that there is a natural way to assign a size
 to the cylinder sets.
\layout Standard

The sub-base of a topology is a collection of sets such that any finite
 intersection or union of such sets belongs to the topology, and that furthermor
e, every set in the topology can be written as a finite intersection or
 union of sets in the sub-base.
 
\layout Standard

A sigma algebra then consists of the topology, together with a function,
 the measure, that assigns a non-negative, real value to every element of
 the topology.
 The measure must satisfy a property called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sigma-additivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

: the measure of the union of a number of disjoint sets must equal the sum
 of the measures of each set.
 Notationally, sigma-additivity requires that:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i\in I}\, a_{i}\right)=\sum_{i\in I}\mu\left(a_{i}\right)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where each of the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset 

 are pairwise-disjoint from the other sets, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset 

 is a (countable) collection of indecies of the sets being considered.
\layout Standard

The cylinder sets may be defined as follows.
 Let the positions on the lattice be labelled by an integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 The elements of the sub-base of the sigma algebra can be completely enumerated
 by ordered pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $(n,s)$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a string in two letters of finite length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

, for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $k<\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(n,s)$
\end_inset 

 is to be visualized as the set of all states where the lattice values between
 location 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n+k-1$
\end_inset 

 are equal to the string 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{(n,s)}$
\end_inset 

 denote an element of this sub-base.
\layout Standard

The sub-base of a topology is a collection of sets, which, by intersection
 and union, generate the rest of the topology.
 A brief review of intersection and union is in order.
 The intersection 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{(n,s)}\cap C_{(m,t)}$
\end_inset 

 is the set of all configurations that match 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 
\emph on 
AND
\emph default 
 match 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset 

.
 The union 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{(n,s)}\cup C_{(m,t)}$
\end_inset 

 is as above, with 
\emph on 
OR
\emph default 
 taking the place of 
\emph on 
AND
\emph default 
.
\layout Standard

Let the two letters that occur in the string be 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{(n,A)}\cap C_{(n,B)}=\varnothing\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{(n,AAA)}\cap C_{(n,AAB)}=\varnothing\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{(n,A)}\cup C_{(n,B)}=\Omega\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset 

 representing the entire space.
 One noteworthy aspect of this topology is the somewhat intuitively "backwards"
 relation between the string labels and the sets, in that when two strings
 overlap, its is likely that the intersection of the corresponding sets
 will be empty, whereas when the strings don't overlap, the intersection
 will never be empty.
 Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
C_{(n,s)}\cap C_{(m,t)}\ne\varnothing\]

\end_inset 

whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $m>n+\mbox{len}(s)$
\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{len}(s)$
\end_inset 

 is the length of the string.
\layout Subsubsection

Measures on cylinder sets 
\layout Standard

The measure is a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset 

 that assigns to each element 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{(n,s)}$
\end_inset 

 a real, non-negative value.
 It is convenient to normalize the measure such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\varnothing)=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\Omega)=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The requirement of sigma-additivity implies that all other values will
 be less than one.
 A measure will be said to be 
\emph on

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(C_{(n,s)})=\mu(C_{(m,s)})$
\end_inset 

 for all

\layout Standard

ToDo XXX finish this section.
\layout Standard

We can use sigma additivity to construct a collection of translation invariant
 measures as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(C_{(n,A)})=x$
\end_inset 

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 Then sigma-additivity requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(C_{(n,B)})=1-x$
\end_inset 

 which follows from the fact that the union of these two disjoint sets is
 the entire space.
 One may readily deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mu(C_{(n,s)})=x^{\# A(s)}(1-x)^{\# B(s)}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\# A(s)$
\end_inset 

 is the number of times the letter 'A' occurs in the string ''s'', and likewise
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\# B(s)$
\end_inset 

.
 In most physics applications, the canonical and symmetric choice would
 be 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset 

, but it should be clear that this is not mathematically constrained.
 One might even be able to make physical arguments to have ''x'' be something
 other than one-half, if, for example (and maybe a bad example), some external
 force is causing there to be more spins pointing in one direction than
 the other, on average.

Lets pursue this idea just a bit further.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}=\{ s\,:\;\mbox{len}(s)=k\}$
\end_inset 

 be the set of all strings of length ''k''.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall s,t\in\sigma_{k},s\ne t$
\end_inset 

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{(n,s)}\cap C_{(n,t)}=\varnothing$
\end_inset 

, that is, this set of strings defines sets that are pair-wise disjoint.
 One has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bigcup_{s\in\sigma_{k}}C_{(n,s)}=\Omega\]

\end_inset 

and, from sigma additivity, we deduce 
\begin_inset Formula \[
1=\mu\left(\bigcup_{s\in\sigma_{k}}C_{(n,s)}\right)=\sum_{s\in\sigma_{k}}\mu\left(C_{(n,s)}\right)=\sum_{s\in\sigma_{k}}x^{\# A(s)}(1-x)^{\# B(s)}=\sum_{j=0}^{k}{{k \choose j}}x^{j}(1-x)^{k-j}=1\]

\end_inset

\layout Standard

-- use the transfer matrix to move out of the measure into to the potential:
 the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator to compute the partition function.
\layout Standard

-- lather rinse repeat .
\layout Standard

-- addition and subtraction
\layout Standard

-- multiplication
\layout Standard

-- The topology is second countable, since the cylinder sets are countable.
\layout Standard

-- Its not first countable: can use the cantor-slash argument on any listing
 of the neighborhood bases of a point.
\layout Standard

-- clarify use of base vs.
 subbase in above: the intersection of cylinder sets is a cylinder set,
 to its a base, not a subbase.
\layout Standard

-- it's Hausdorff, its esentially the topology of the real number line.
