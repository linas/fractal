\begin_layout Title
The Bernoulli Operator

\begin_layout Abstract
This paper reviews a raft of related ideas surrounding the Bernoulli operator.
 The Bernoulli operator is the transfer operator or Frobenius-Perron operator
 of the Bernoulli map.
 The Bernoulli map is a simple map of the unit interval onto itself, which
 has the effect of discarding the leading binary digit of the binary expansion
 of a number upon every iteration.
 This map has been well studied for over a century, and much, if not all,
 of what is presented here is well-known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If there is anything new here, then perhaps it is a representation of the
 Bernoulli map eigenfunctions in terms of the Takagi curve (or Blancmange
 curve).
 In particular, it is shown that the Hurwitz-zeta function basis for the
 continuous spectrum is just a linear combination of the Takagi curves,
 and vice-versa.
 I find this curious and important somehow: the Blancmange curve has an
 explicitly fractal self-similarity given by the dyadic monoid.
 The dyadic monoid is the monoid that describes the self-similarity of the
 infinite binary tree and Cantor set, and is a subset of the modular group
 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This paper is part of a set of chapters that explore the relationship between
 the real numbers, the Cantor set, the modular group, and fractals.

\begin_layout Standard
THIS IS A SET OF WORKING NOTES.
 It's somewhat loosely structured, and sometimes messy.
 The presentation alternates between easy, and advanced: many parts of this
 paper are readable by students with modest mathematical knowledge, while
 other sections presume and require expert familiarity.
 In general, the harder topics appear later in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intro hasn't been written yet; but if it was, it would explain why this
 is an interesting topic.
 In short, having a clear understanding of transfer operators is vital to
 the branches of physics concerned with dynamical systems and the arrow
 of time.
 The Bernoulli operator just happens to be a particularly simple, exactly-solvab
le case.

\begin_layout Standard
The layout is roughly as following (xxx this summary needs work)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Define the Bernoulli operator, demonstrate some of its eigenfunctions and
 eigenvalues.
 The presentation is a simplified variant of the material in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, generalized to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic definitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Present the Hurwitz Zeta and fractal eigenfunctions; show that these are
 just linear combinations of one-another, and span the same space.
 Notable is the fact that the fractal eigenfunctions are not differentiable
 on the rational numbers, whereas the Hurwitz Zeta eigenvalues are classically
 differentiable almost everywhere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Present a more abstract, but more firm/well-founded foundation for the earlier
 results.
 The more abstract formulation is in terms of the Cantor set.
 Here, we take the Cantor set to be the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}=2\times2\times\cdots$
\end_inset

 of a countably infinite number 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 of copies of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $2=\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 That is, we take the Cantor set to be the set of all infinitely long strings
 of binary digits, taken with the product topology.
 Of course, strings of binary digits can represent the real numbers; but
 the Cantor set differs from the real numbers in that, unlike the reals,
 one has 
\begin_inset Formula $0.111\cdots\ne1.000\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 This foundation can then lead to deeper results, as well as shed light
 on some of the more confusing/paradoxical results that arise in the informal
 treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Show that the Perron-Frobenius operator is the measure-theoretic pullback.
 This is a nice, formal, category-theoretic way of defining the FP transfer
 operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the sections, including the sections on orthogonality and completeness,
 are insufficiently rigorous, and could be tightened up a good bit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some new results that are general (and not related to Bernoulli) are presented
 here: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The paragraph following 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lattice shift eigenfunction"

\end_inset

 which generalizes the Wold decomposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Wold-decomposition"

\end_inset

, and shows how to build eigenfunctions, in general, for any transfer operator
 on any Cartesian product space.
 (It would be nice to reconcile this with the results of Ding
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ding1998"

\end_inset

 as to the domain of the spectrum (a disk, for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

spaces, which are the most frequently studied).
 Now, one of the recurring themes in this set of papers is self-similarity
 and scaling behavior; such self-similarity will always hold, in general,
 on uniform Cartesian products; and so many new, general facts could be
 easily stated here as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The results of section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Measure-theoretic-description"

\end_inset

 are entirely new, as far as I know, and provide a much clearer vocabulary
 (to me, at least) with which to talk about transfer operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some new results that are specific to the Bernoulli operator:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The presentation of the Hurwitz zeta eigenfunctions, of section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Hurwitz-zeta-eigenfns"

\end_inset

, I believe are new and have never been reported before.
 Notable is that these are well-defined for eigenvalues lying outside of
 the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|\le1$
\end_inset

; in fact, these are well-defined for any complex 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 This in no way contradicts general results that the spectrum of Frobenius-Perro
n operators lies in the unit disk when one considers eigenfunctions that
 lie in 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 These eigenfunctions are analytic; they are just not integrable over the
 entire unit interval.
 This simply shows: there is more to life than just the spectrum inside
 the unit disk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The presentation of the fractal eigenfunctions, of section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Fractal-eigenfunctions"

\end_inset

, are new; the observation that these are self-similar and have a scaling
 behavior is new.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of the transfer operator was introduced by David Ruelle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ruelle1986"

\end_inset

[verify ref] as a powerful mechanism for studying the nature of iterated
 maps.
 Before this, iterated functions were typically studied by looking at the
 trajectories of sets of points.
 This approach, though obvious, has disadvantages for both the disciplines
 of physics (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 loss of differentiability) and mathematics (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 non-measurable sets, axiom of choice).
 The transfer operator, sometimes called the Perron-Frobenius operator,
 or the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator, provides a different, stronger
 setting, by making incorporating the topology of the space that the map
 acts on.
 This section provides a gentle introduction to the concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, an iterated function 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

 maps a space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to itself.
 When studying an iterated function, one often asks about the orbits of
 points: Are there fixed points, attractors or repellors, or saddle points?
 Is the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 may be ergodic or chaotic? Endowing the set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 with a topology (for the unit interval, the natural topology on the reals),
 one typically asks if 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is strong or weak mixing, or merely topologically mixing.
 The above questions may all be grouped under a heading: 'the study of iterated
 operators by means of point set topology'.
 A change in perspective is gained by introducing a measure on the space
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 This radically alters how 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider how 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 acts on distributions, rather than points.
 Suppose the space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, consider a dusting of points on the unit interval, with a
 local density given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, and then consider how this dusting or density evolves upon iteration by
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 This verbal description may be given form as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\rho^{\prime}(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\,\delta\left(y-g(x)\right)\rho(x)\; dx\label{eq:transfer-dirac}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\prime}(y)$
\end_inset

 is the new density at point 
\begin_inset Formula $y=g(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function.
 In this viewpoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 becomes an operator that maps densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to other densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, or notationally, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho=\rho^{\prime}\]

\end_inset

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is called the transfer operator or the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator.
 It is a linear operator, for clearly 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{g}(a\rho_{1}+b\rho_{2})=a\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho_{1}+b\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho_{2}\]

\end_inset

for constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 and densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1},\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

density
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is a smooth map from the unit interval to the non-negative reals, there
 is no particular need to enforce this.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 may be a map from the unit interval to any ring 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and it need not be smooth, differentiable or even continuous.
 Usually, we'll take the ring 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to the reals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, but in fact, it could be any ring or field.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is an operator that maps functions on the unit interval to other functions
 on the unit interval: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{g}:\mathcal{F}\left[0,1\right]\to\mathcal{F}\left[0,1\right]\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\in\mathcal{F}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The precise properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 depend strongly on what, exactly, is taken to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the set of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 An exploration of the different spaces makes up much of the content of
 this paper.
 There are many spaces to choose from: the space of polynomials, the space
 of square-integrable functions, or possibly yet other spaces.
 In general, the properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 depend on the topology given to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Most generally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is an operator acting on a topological space endowed with multiplication
 and addition, that is, a topological vector space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:transfer-dirac"

\end_inset

, for a general space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, requires the definition of an integral on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and the definition of the Dirac delta function.
 This is in general possible only when 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is endowed with a measure and the associated Borel sigma algebra.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left[X\right]$
\end_inset

 then must be a space of of measurable, sigma-additive functions, if eqn
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:transfer-dirac"

\end_inset

 is to be meaningful.
 Given this setting, the transfer operator turns out to be one and the same
 as the push-forward of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 on the set of measurable, sigma-additive functions.
 A formalization and proof of this is given in a much later section.
 For most of what follows, though, these formalities can be avoided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is differentiable, and doesn't have a vanishing derivative, the transfer
 operator can be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{g}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x:y=g(x)}\frac{\rho(x)}{\left|dg(x)/dx\right|}\label{eq: transfer-jacobi}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the sum is presumed to extend over at most a countable number of points.
 It is not at all hard to show that, for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class of differentiable functions, that 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:transfer-dirac"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

 are equivalent definitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator, all of the usual language of operator theory may
 be brought to bear on its study.
 As a start, one looks for its representations and the eigenvectors and
 eigenspaces associated with each representation.
 It is typically pertinent to discuss any symmetries and isomorphisms these
 spaces might have.
 Thus, for example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is a compact operator, then it's spectrum is constrained by well-known
 theorems[need ref]: the spectrum is discrete, countable, bounded, and,
 if infinite, has an accumulation point at zero.
 It is from here whence the transfer operator gets the name 'Perron-Frobenius':
 insofar as compact operators are 'a lot like' finite matrices, the Perron-Frobe
nius theorem applies.
 So, for example, if one chooses the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left[X\right]$
\end_inset

 to be the space of polynomials on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, then, for many 'reasonable' 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is compact.
 After we narrow the discussion to the Bernoulli operator, we will find
 that this is exactly the case.
 Alternately, one may choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left[X\right]$
\end_inset

 to be a Banach space, or possibly a Hilbert space of square-integrable
 functions on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, it turns out that, for many 'reasonable' 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, that the conjugate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is and isometry and specifically, a shift operator.
 In this case, it is well-known from the Wold-von Neumann decomposition
 that the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 fills the entire unit disk on the complex plane.
 We'll provide several constructions for the Bernoulli operator that exhibit
 this (and more; a spectrum that fills the entire complex plane!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insofar as 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 have a physical interpretation, the eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

 are called Ruelle resonances
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ruelle1986"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor set, and more generally, the product topology on infinite Cartesian
 products, plays a special role in what follows.
 This is in part due to the nature of shift operators and the Wold decomposition
, but can be considered a generalization.
 To keep things simple, consider the unit interval.
 For any 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, one may write the decimal expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=0.d_{1}d_{2}d_{3}\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}d_{n}10^{-n}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th decimal digit of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The space of all such decimal expansions is the Cartesian product 
\begin_inset Formula $D\times D\times D\times\cdots$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the finite set 
\begin_inset Formula $D=\left\{ 0,1,2,3,\cdots,9\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Although this is 'obvious', it is not commonly appreciated that this infinite
 Cartesian product is the Cantor set.
 This has practical implications for the study of transfer operators: one
 may choose to work with not only the 'natural' topology on the unit interval,
 but also with the Cantor set topology (aka the product topology or 'cylinder
 set' topology).
 This can have a subtle effect on the space of measurable functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}\left[X\right]$
\end_inset

, and can, as well, open up new ways of thinking about the problem, thus
 offering additional tools, techniques and theorems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be more precise, one considers the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 to consist of the set of strings 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega=\left\{ \sigma=(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots)\,:\,\sigma_{k}\in\left\{ 0,1,\ldots,p-1\right\} \,,\, x=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sigma_{k}p^{-(k+1)}\;,\, x\in[0,1]\right\} \]

\end_inset

Intuitively, this set is simply the set of all the digits of a base-
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 expansion of the real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 That one may consider a shift operator on this space is now intuitively
 obvious; that this shift operator has anything at all to do with that of
 the Wold decomposition is less so.
 This connection will be explored in greater detail in this text.
 This space is equivalent to the collection of all field configurations
 of a one-dimensional, one-sided lattice, where each lattice location can
 take on one of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 values.
 In physics, such lattices are called 'spin lattices' or 'spin networks';
 this cross-over of concepts provides another way of gaining insight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few more remarks remain in order.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 may be endowed with one of two different metrics: the natural metric, the
 closure of which leads to the natural topology on the real numbers, and
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic metric, whose closure gives the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic numbers.
 These are important to the study of finite function fields and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic analysis in general.
 Although this can be quite interesting, this text does not currently deal
 any further with the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic metric or the resulting closure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real numbers also have yet another product representation.
 By considering 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\times\cdots$
\end_inset

, one has sequences of positive integers that may be interpreted as a continued
 fraction: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=[0;\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\ldots]=\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{2}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{3}+\ldots}}}\]

\end_inset

The measure on this product space is radically different than the usual
 measure, and is considerably harder to study; it is the Minkowski measure,
 the derivative of the Minkowski question-mark function.

 to the study of transfer operators for continued fractions may be found

Transfer Operator of the Bernoulli Map

The Bernoulli map is important in physics as an exactly solvable example
 of deterministic chaos.
 Its importance to physics is emphasized in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Dri99"

\end_inset

, where a presentation of this map, its associated transfer operator and
 its solution in terms of polynomial eigenfunctions is given.
 A purely mathematical treatment of the operator, considered as a shift

.
 This and the next section recaps those results using a simplified development
 and simpler tools.
 The simplified development enables the discussion of more complex scenarios,
 given in later sections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli map is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b(x)=2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \label{eq:Bernoulli map}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 denotes the integer part of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The map can be thought of as popping the leading digit off of the binary
 or 2-adic expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x.$
\end_inset

 This map has a positive Lyapunov exponent and is highly chaotic, as, in
 a certain sense, one can say that the digits of the binary expansion of
 some 'arbitrary' number are 'unpredictable', and that the orbits of two
 close-by numbers will eventually become 'uncorrelated' (after suitably
 defining what we mean by 'arbitrary' and 'unpredictable').
 Closely related is the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic map, given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
a(x)=px-\left\lfloor px\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 an integer.
 As above, this map has the effect of popping off the leading digit of the
 base-
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 In a similar vein, one may also consider the Gauss map
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(x)=\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset

which has the effect of lopping of the leading digit of the continued fraction
 expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 What these three maps have in common is that they deal with different (and,
 in a certain sense, inequivalent) representations of the continuum of real
 numbers.
 Each map is chaotic, but in a different way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator or transfer operator of the Bernoulli
 map is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+f\left(\frac{x+1}{2}\right)\right]\label{eq:Bernoulli operator}\end{equation}

 Similarly, the transfer operator for the general 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic map is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{p}f\right](x)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}f\left(\frac{x+k}{p}\right)\label{eq:p-adic operator}\end{equation}

\end_inset

while that for the Gauss map is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{G}f\right](x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\;\frac{1}{(x+k)^{2}}\; f\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)\]

\end_inset

This last is known as the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above, the properties of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 depend on the function space on which it acts, and the topology to be used
 on the unit interval.
 In particular, the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 can vary from being discrete, to being continuous, depending on the the
 function space and topology.
 The simplest case assumes the natural topology of the reals on the unit
 interval, and takes as the function space the set of orthogonal polynomials
 on the unit interval.
 In this case, the eigenfunctions may be shown to be the Bernoulli polynomials
 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

, associated with the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, one finds that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}B_{n}\right](x)=\frac{1}{2^{n}}B_{n}(x)\]

\end_inset

where the first few 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{0}(x)= & 1\\
B_{1}(x)= & x-\frac{1}{2}\\
B_{2}(x)= & x^{2}-x+\frac{1}{6}\\
B_{3}(x)= & x^{3}-\frac{3x^{2}}{2}+\frac{x}{2}\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so on.
 Perhaps the easiest proof that these are the eigenfunctions may be obtained
 by considering the generating function for the Bernoulli polynomials:
\begin_inset Formula \[
G(x,t)=\frac{te^{xt}}{e^{t}-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}(x)\,\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\]

\end_inset

It is then straight-forward to verify that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}G\right](x,t)=\frac{1}{2}\left[G\left(\frac{x}{2},t\right)+G\left(\frac{x+1}{2},t\right)\right]=G\left(x,\frac{t}{2}\right)\]

\end_inset

or equivalently, by applying the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

, that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}G\right](x,t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}B_{n}\right](x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)^{n}\frac{B_{n}(x)}{n!}\]

\end_inset

and then equating the coefficients of the powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Theorem*
The eigenvalues of the

 That is, one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{p}B_{n}\right](x)=\frac{1}{p^{n}}B_{n}(x)\]

\begin_layout Proof
The proof proceeds as in the above 2-adic case, and hinges on the factorization
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
w^{p}-1=\left(w-1\right)\left(w^{p-1}+w^{p-2}+\cdots+1\right)\]

\end_inset

 Here, take 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{p}-1=e^{t}-1$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{p}G\right](x,t) & = & \frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}G\left(\frac{x+k}{p},t\right)\\
 & = & \frac{1}{p}\frac{t}{e^{t}-1}\,\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\exp\left(\frac{(x+k)t}{p}\right)\\
 & = & \frac{t}{p}\;\frac{\left(1+e^{t/p}+e^{2t/p}+\cdots+e^{(p-1)t/p}\right)}{e^{t}-1}\\
 & = & G\left(x,\frac{t}{p}\right)\end{eqnarray*}

\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 of the generating function, one obtains the desired result.

The above theorem is a fancy restatement of an old and well-known result

multiplication theorem
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 given by Joseph Ludwig Raabe in 1851[need ref].
 This is usually given in the more prosaic form of
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{n}(px)=p^{n-1}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}B_{n}\left(x+\frac{k}{p}\right)\]

\end_inset

but amounts to the same thing.
 Curiously, multiplication theorems exist not only for the Bernoulli polynomials
, but more broadly, including the Gamma function and the Hurwitz zeta function.
 A later section will give a more general set of eigenfunctions in terms
 of the Hurwitz zeta.
 Several other connections to number theory are worth pointing out.
 Sums of the above kind are not atypical in the study of automorphic and
 modular forms; indeed, the Hecke operator
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 of number theory is essentially the sum of the Bernoulli operator and its
 transpose.
 This is perhaps not accidental: later sections will construct fractal eigenfunc

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{p}$

 that have self-similarity under the dyadic monoid, which is a certain subset
 of the modular group.

The following sections provide a more abstract and belabored derivation
 of the above result.
 The goal of the abstraction is to develop the machinery needed to explore
 the Bernoulli operator in more general topological settings.
 Rather than starting with the Hilbert space of orthogonal polynomials on
 the unit interval, the next section defines a Banach space on monomials,
 and its dual.
 The subsequent section then exposes the matrix elements of the Bernoulli

The Polynomial Representation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for working with polynomials is that they provide a convenient
 way of working with infinitely-differentiable functions.
 A polynomial, with a finite number of terms, is inherently bounded on the
 unit interval.
 This is not generally the case when working with a square-integrable Hilbert
 space; square-integrable functions can be badly discontinuous, nor are
 they, in general, bounded.
 The hand-waving physics behind this is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nature is smooth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so, insofar as the operator is a model for some natural physical process,
 one wants to stick to smooth functions.
 As will be seen, this has a tremendous effect on the spectrum of the operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial eigenvectors of the Bernoulli operator can be derived in
 several ways.
 One seemingly reasonable initial approach is to start with a Hilbert space
 of orthogonal polynomials on the unit interval.
 This approach is taken by Driebe
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99"

\end_inset

, who starts with the Legendre polynomials, rescaled to the unit interval,
 and obtains the resulting Bernoulli eigenvectors.
 This allows for a derivation of the right eigenvectors, but is then discovered
 to generate difficulties when considering the left eigenvectors.
 This arises because the the Bernoulli operator is not invertible in this
 Hilbert space: it is quite singular, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}f\right]=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is skew about 1/2, that is, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)=-f(1/2+y)$
\end_inset

.
 A set of left eigenvectors can be found, but these are not polynomials
 or even ordinary real-valued functions; rather, they are generalized functions,
 expressed as derivatives of the Dirac delta function.
 In essence, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular value decomposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is thus performed on the Bernoulli operator, but, as the operator is not
 'nice' or 'symmetric' in any common sense, the left and right factors don't
 have any particular structure or relation to one-another.
 From this exercise, one concludes that starting with a Hilbert space of
 orthogonal polynomials offers no particular benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generalized functions are linear functionals from a space of functions to
 the reals.
 That is, generalized functions belong to the dual space of a function space.
 Given that the left eigenvectors of the Bernoulli operator are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

naturally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 found to belong to such a dual space (but only after laborious calculation,
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dri99"

\end_inset

), it then makes sense to work with these, from the start.
 Thus, for the following, an infinite-dimensional vector space will be construct
ed, with the basis elements being the monomials.
 The generalized functions appear naturally as elements of the dual space.
 The transfer operator then has a clear and simple representation in this
 space.
 In principle, this infinite-dimensional vector space may be taken to be
 a Banach space; however, the development below does not make any particular
 use of the norm that Banach spaces are equipped with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an infinite-dimensional vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 with a countable ordered set of linearly independent basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 labelled by the natural numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 A general element 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}e_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 The dual space 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the set of all linear functionals 
\begin_inset Formula $L:V\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 General elements of the dual space may be written as linear combinations
 of the basis elements 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

, which are the maps such that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{j}^{*}(e_{k})=\delta_{jk}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 of real-analytic functions on the unit interval, there are many choices
 one could make for the basis vectors.
 Most obviously, basis elements may be taken to be the monomials 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}=x^{k}$
\end_inset

, so that a general real-analytic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}x^{n}\label{eq:taylor-f}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This may be trivially interpreted as nothing more than the Taylor's series
 for a real-valued function expanded at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 Other possibilities for basis vectors will be considered later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correct formalism for discussing the dual space is a bit trickier.
 Following historical convention, the linear functionals of the dual space
 may be represented as integrals.
 The linear functional 
\begin_inset Formula $L:\mathcal{P}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 may be written as the integral 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}l(x)\, f(x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, such as the Dirac delta function.
 The difficulty with this is, of course, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are not, in general, differentiable and can have other surprising properties.
 However, with care, these can be handled in a consistent manner; a quick
 review follows, as such use is not uncommon.
 The  dual vectors may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{k}^{*}=\frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!}\delta^{(k)}(x)\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function.
 Thus, one has as the duality relation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
e_{j}^{*}\left(e_{k}\right)=\int_{0}^{1}x^{k}\;\frac{(-1)^{j}}{j!}\delta^{(j)}(x)\, dx=\int_{0}^{1}\,\delta(x)\,\frac{d^{j}x^{k}}{dx^{j}}\, dx=\delta_{jk}\label{eq:orthogonality}\end{equation}

\end_inset

after integration by parts.
 The relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:orthogonality"

\end_inset

 above demonstrates orthogonality; one may also show completeness: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e_{n}\otimes e_{n}^{*}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\,\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\delta^{(n)}(y)=\delta(x-y)\label{eq:analytic completeness}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 in that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\int\delta\left(x-y\right)f\left(y\right)dy$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is expressible as an analytic function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another common notation is that of quantum mechanical bra-ket or Dirac notation.
 Here, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|n\right\rangle =e_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n\right|=e_{n}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The orthogonality condition becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n\right|\left.m\right\rangle =\delta_{nm}$
\end_inset

 while for completeness one writes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbb{I}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e_{n}\otimes e_{n}^{*}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|\label{eq:analytic identity}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The re-introduction of the coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is done by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x\right|\left.m\right\rangle =x^{m}$
\end_inset

, while for the transpose one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n\right|\left.x\right\rangle =(-1)^{n}\delta^{(n)}(x)/n!$
\end_inset

.
 The advantage of the bra-ket notation over the use of the 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 is that it can be used to make clear when one is discussing the coordinate
 representation, involving 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x)$
\end_inset

, and when one is discussing the vector space elements in the abstract,
 without reference to the coordinate representation.
 To fully articulate this notation, one may write the Taylor's series as
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
f(x) & = & \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|f\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\left\langle n|f\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\int dy\left\langle n|y\right\rangle \left\langle y|f\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\int dy(-)^{n}\frac{\delta^{(n)}(y)}{n!}f(y)\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\label{eq:Taylors bra-kets}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This notation allows the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}=\left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}\right|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of the transfer operator to be articulated as well.
 Starting with the matrix notation of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:taylor-f"

\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}f\right](x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}b_{m}x^{m}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}x^{m}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}a_{n}\]

\end_inset

or, equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}f\right](x)=\left\langle x\left|\mathcal{L}f\right.\right\rangle =\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|m\right.\right\rangle \left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}f\right.\right\rangle =\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|m\right.\right\rangle \left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}\right|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|f\right\rangle \]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|f\right\rangle =a_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n\left|\mathcal{L}f\right.\right\rangle =b_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Equating each power of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{m}$
\end_inset

 one finds, in the matrix notation, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{1}{m!}\;\frac{d^{m}\left[\mathcal{L}f\right](x)}{dx^{m}}\right|_{x=0}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}U_{mn}\left.\frac{1}{n!}\;\frac{d^{n}f(x)}{dx^{n}}\right|_{x=0}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle n|f\right\rangle =a_{n}=\left.\frac{1}{n!}\;\frac{d^{n}f(x)}{dx^{n}}\right|_{x=0}\]

\end_inset

and so on.
 The formulation of the transfer operator given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 fits in this framework as well; it is merely the spatial representation
 of the matrix elements: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}

 & = & \left\langle x\left|\mathcal{L}\right|y\right\rangle =\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x|m\right\rangle \left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}\right|n\right\rangle \left\langle n|y\right\rangle \end{eqnarray*}

\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}x^{k}\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{k}+\left(\frac{1+x}{2}\right)^{k}\right]\]

\end_inset

Both the diagonal elements, and the reason for the appearance of the binomial
 coefficients should be immediately clear.
 Note that the evaluation of these matrix elements does not require the

 Letting the left eigenvectors be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

, they have, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset

, the components 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle =\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{n}\left(\delta_{nk}+\Theta_{nk}\right)\label{eq:B-left matrix elts}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The zeroth left eigenvector is a special-case; it has components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{0}\right|k\right\rangle =1/(k+1)$
\end_inset

.
 Unlike the right eigenvectors, the left eigenvectors all have an infinite
 number of non-zero components.
 They share the same eigenvalue spectrum with the right eigenvectors, so
 that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|m\right\rangle U_{mk}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle \]

\end_inset

This may again be demonstrated by a brute-force evaluation of the sum.
 Despite the fact that an infinite number of the left eigenvector components
 are non-vanishing, this sum will only contain a finite number of non-zero
 terms, and thus its finiteness is guaranteed on algebraic grounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may write down a coordinate-space representation for the left eigenvectors,
 by contracting them against the dual-space basis elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle k|x\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 This leads directly to the generalized functions: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}|x\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle \left\langle k|x\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle (-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)(-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{k!}\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n!}\left[\delta^{(n-1)}(1-x)-\delta^{(n-1)}(x)\right]\label{eq:left bernoulli}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n>0$
\end_inset

 case.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

 left eigenvector is best understood by integrating it over some arbitrary
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1}dx\,\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{0}\right|x\right\rangle f(x)= & \int_{0}^{1}dx\, f(x)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-)^{k}\frac{\delta^{(k)}(x)}{(k+1)!}\\
= & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{(k+1)!}\\
= & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}\int_{0}^{1}x^{k}dx\\
= & \int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx\\
= & \left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{0}\right|f\right\rangle \end{align*}

\end_inset

The other left eigenvectors can also be made more concrete by looking at
 how they act on some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

; this may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|f\right\rangle =\frac{1}{n!}\left[f^{(n-1)}(1)-f^{(n-1)}(0)\right]\label{eq:B-tilde acting on f}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Duality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the left eigenvectors are dual to the Bernoulli polynomials, which
 can be verified in either the matrix-element basis, or the coordinate-space
 representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem*
The left and right eigenvectors are dual, in that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|B_{m}\right\rangle =\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle \left\langle k\left|B_{m}\right.\right\rangle =\delta_{nm}\]

\end_inset

and furthermore, the duality is algebraic, in that no infinite sums need
 be performed to demonstrate duality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider first the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

 case.
 One has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{0}\right|B_{m}\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{0}\right|k\right\rangle \left\langle k\left|B_{m}\right.\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{1}{k+1}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{m-k}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{m+1}\sum_{j=0}^{m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m+1\\
j\end{array}\right)B_{j}\\
 & = & \delta_{m0}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $j=m-k$
\end_inset

 was made to obtain the last sum.
 The vanishing of the last sum is a well-known identity on the Bernoulli
 numbers.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ne0$
\end_inset

 case requires more work, but ends similarly: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|B_{m}\right\rangle  & = & \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|k\right\rangle \left\langle k\left|B_{m}\right.\right\rangle \\
 & = & \sum_{k=0}^{m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{n}\left(\delta_{nk}+\Theta_{nk}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{m-k}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
n\end{array}\right)B_{m-n}+\sum_{k=n+1}^{m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
k\end{array}\right)B_{m-k}\\
 & = & \begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ for }n>m\\
B_{0} & \mbox{ for }n=m\\
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
n\end{array}\right)B_{m-n}+\frac{m!}{n!(m-n+1)!}\sum_{k=n+1}^{m}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m-n+1\\
m-k\end{array}\right)B_{m-k} & \mbox{ for }n<m\end{cases}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The last case can be shown to vanish, by again making the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $j=m-k$
\end_inset

, to get 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m\\
n\end{array}\right)B_{m-n} & + & \frac{m!}{n!(m-n+1)!}\sum_{j=0}^{m-n-1}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m-n+1\\
j\end{array}\right)B_{j}\\
 & = & \frac{m!}{n!(m-n+1)!}\sum_{j=0}^{m-n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
m-n+1\\
j\end{array}\right)B_{j}=0\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

thus concluding the proof.
 Notice that this proof does not require the evaluation of any infinite
 sums: all sums are performed over a finite number of terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This proof of duality may also be conducted in coordinate space, where it
 takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|B_{m}\right\rangle  & = & \int_{0}^{1}\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\left|B_{m}\right.\right\rangle \, dx\nonumber \\
 & = & \int_{0}^{1}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n!}\left[\delta^{(n-1)}(1-x)-\delta^{(n-1)}(x)\right]B_{m}(x)\, dx\nonumber \\
 & = & \begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ for }m<n-1\\
\frac{m!}{n!(m-n+1)!}\left[B_{m-n+1}(1)-B_{m-n+1}(0)\right] & \mbox{ for }m\ge n-1\end{cases}\nonumber \\
 & = & \delta_{mn}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

and so, as with most of the previous results, one may be lulled into a sense
 of complacency about the equivalence of the coordinate-space and monomial-vecto
r-space representations.
 This complacency is ill-founded, as demonstrated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Completeness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this duality, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbb{I}_{B}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\label{eq:Bern-ident}\end{equation}

\end_inset

can then be recognized as a projection operator.
 In fact, it is algebraically complete in the monomial basis, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle j\left|\mathbb{I}_{B}\right|k\right\rangle =\left\langle j\right|\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\left|k\right\rangle =\delta_{jk}\label{eq:B-complete}\end{equation}

\end_inset

holds.
 This can be shown using essentially the same operations as in the proof
 above.
 Also, as before, this demonstration involves sums with only a finite number
 of terms, and so completeness may be taken as an algebraic property.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 may be taken to be the identity operator on the vector space of polynomials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiously, this identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 expanded in the Bernoulli basis as in formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula in disguise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gas92,Dri99"

\end_inset

.
 This may be seen by expanding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
f(x) & = & \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}B_{m}(x)\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{m}\right|f\right\rangle \label{eq:B-maclaurin}\\
 & = & \int_{0}^{1}f(y)\, dy+\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_{m}(x)}{m!}\left[f^{(m-1)}(1)-f^{(m-1)}(0)\right]\nonumber \end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

This may be compared to the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 case of the traditional Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f\left(\frac{k+x}{n}\right)=\int_{0}^{1}f(y)\, dy+\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{B_{m}(x)}{n^{m}m!}\left[f^{(m-1)}(1)-f^{(m-1)}(0)\right]\]

\end_inset

By combining equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:B-complete"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:B-maclaurin"

\end_inset

 one is sorely tempted to deduce orthogonality over coordinate space.
 That is, one wants to deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|B_{n}\right.\right\rangle \left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|y\right\rangle =\delta(x-y)\label{eq: Bernoulli-faulty}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which superficially seems to be entirely reasonable.
 The problem with equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Bernoulli-faulty"

\end_inset

 is that it is misleading.
 As long as the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 are in all cases understood to be polynomials (
\emph on
i.e
\emph default
.
 with a finite number of terms, and not infinite series), then there is
 no harm in using equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Bernoulli-faulty"

\end_inset

.
 This follows in part because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 really is the identity operator on the space of polynomials: there are
 no polynomials (other than 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=0$
\end_inset

) that are in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, as a space, the space of polynomials is not itself complete: the
 space does not contain all of its limit points.
 That is, there are sequences of polynomials that converge to infinite series;
 these infinite series are, by definition, not polynomials, and so are not
 a part of the space.
 So, for example, consider the series expansion for the sine wave.
 Truncated at any finite number of terms, the result is a polynomial.
 This sequence of ever-higher degree polynomials can be understood to converge
 to the sine wave (once an appropriate definition of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

convergence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is given).
 However, the sine wave belongs to the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

: taking 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\sin2\pi x$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli operator"

\end_inset

, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}\sin2\pi x=0$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}\sin2\pi nx=0$
\end_inset

 for any odd integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

; and so, in this completed space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 has a rather large kernel.
 Its just that no polynomial belongs to that kernel; one requires the completion
 of the space of polynomials by infinite series to find the non-trivial
 kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 is just a projection, the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 are identical.
 Put another way: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 has a large, non-trivial kernel on the completed space, while, by contrast,
 the Dirac delta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(x-y)$
\end_inset

 only has a trivial kernel.
 Thus, on the completion of the space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}\ne\delta\left(x-y\right)$
\end_inset

, in contradiction to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
The Bernoulli operator in diagonal form; the Koopman operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above manipulations, one may deduce that, in the polynomial representat
ion, the Frobenius-Perron operator of the Bernoulli map is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{B}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \lambda_{n}\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\]

\end_inset

We can make use of this diagonal form to easily compute formal expressions
 involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 that is expressible as a polynomial series in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one may write the operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(\mathcal{L}_{B}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle f\left(\lambda_{n}\right)\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\]

\end_inset

whose matrix elements can be explicitly demonstrated in the monomial basis:
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle j\left|f\left(\mathcal{L}_{B}\right)\right|k\right\rangle =\sum_{j\leq n\leq k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
k\\
n-1\end{array}\right)\frac{B_{n-j}}{n}f\left(2^{-n}\right)\]

\end_inset

As in previous cases, note that the summation involves only a finite number
 of terms, and is thus manifestly finite (provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is finite).
 As curious example, one may write, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}=\exp(-H_{B})$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}=-\log\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 has matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle j\left|H_{B}\right|k\right\rangle =\frac{\log(2)}{k+1}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k+1\\
j\end{array}\right)\sum_{m=0}^{k-j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
k-j+1\\
m\end{array}\right)(j+m)\, B_{m}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 are zero.
 In the previous section, it was shown that the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 is trivial.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 is invertible.
 This inverse is known as the 
\emph on
Koopman operator
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{B}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{K}_{B}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \frac{1}{\lambda_{n}}\left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\]

\end_inset

By duality and algebraic completeness, one has that the Koopman operator
 is both a left and a right inverse, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{B}\mathcal{K}_{B}=\mathcal{K}_{B}\mathcal{L}_{B}=\mathbb{I}_{B}\]

\end_inset

in the polynomial representation.
 In this representation, one may honestly write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{B}=\mathcal{L}_{B}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 This will not at all be the case when one considers the Bernoulli operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 acting on the appropriately-defined completions of the space of polynomials,
 or on other function spaces: it will be seen to have a large and non-trivial
 kernel, and so it will not be invertible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Change of Basis Recap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section simply recaps the previous results.
 It was seen above that the monomials form a complete set of basis states
 that can be used to represent polynomials.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{M}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|$
\end_inset

 can be called the identity operator over the space of polynomials; it has
 no non-trivial kernel in that space.
 Here, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is used to indicate that the identity operator is built from the monomial
 states.
 Thus, for the Bernoulli operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

, one may confidently write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}=\mathbb{I}_{M}\mathcal{L}_{B}\mathbb{I}_{M}$
\end_inset

 which expands to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{B}=\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Monomial}}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|m\right\rangle \left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}_{B}\right|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|\]

\end_inset

The superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Monomial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a formal label, used only to emphasize the basis in which the operator
 was expanded in.
 As seen above, the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{mn}\equiv\left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}_{B}\right|n\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are upper-triangular.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 is also the identity operator on the space of polynomials.
 Using the same trick to write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{B}=\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}}=\mathbb{I}_{B}\mathcal{L}_{B}\mathbb{I}_{B}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{m}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{m}\left|\mathcal{L}_{B}\right|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|\]

\end_inset

one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}}$
\end_inset

 is an operator which has matrix elements that are non-zero only on the
 diagonal: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle B_{m}\left|U_{B}\right|\tilde{B}_{n}\right\rangle =\delta_{mn}\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the change of basis from the monomial basis to the Bernoulli
 basis.
 Explicitly, this change of basis is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}} & = & \sum_{j,k=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{j}\right\rangle \delta_{jk}\lambda_{k}\left\langle \tilde{B}_{k}\right|\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{j,k,m,n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{j}\right\rangle \left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{j}\right|m\right\rangle \left\langle m\left|\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Monomial}}\right|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\left|B_{k}\right.\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{k}\right|\nonumber \\
 & = & \tilde{B}\,\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Monomial}}\, B\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 show the change of basis: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{B}=\sum_{j,m=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{j}\right\rangle \left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{j}\right|m\right\rangle \left\langle m\right|\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
B=\sum_{k,n=0}^{\infty}\left|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\left|B_{k}\right.\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{k}\right|\]

\end_inset

It is not hard to work out that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}B=\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $B\tilde{B}=\mathbb{I}_{M}$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}$
\end_inset

 is both a left- and right-inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

; one may confidently write 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{-1}=\tilde{B}$
\end_inset

 as a two-sided inverse.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}$
\end_inset

 are inverses of one-another, they are in no way orthogonal.
 The matrix elements of the transpose of an orthogonal operator are equal
 to those of the inverse; a quick review of equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:B-right matrix elts"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 makes it clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{k}\right|n\right\rangle \ne\left\langle n\left|B_{k}\right.\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is not an orthogonal operator.
 This is not a surprise: orthogonal operators cannot take a diagonal operator
 and make it triangular.

\begin_layout Section
Topology, Completeness and Orthogonality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notions of completeness and orthogonality are treated above without
 any appeal to topology.
 That is, they are handled with what is essentially an algebraic approach,
 where all sums are finite and well defined because all sums involve only
 a finite number of non-zero terms.
 This was possible in part by construction, and in part by luck: the Bernoulli
 operator was a solvable, upper-triangular matrix in the infinite vector
 space whose basis elements are the monomials.
 A sum over monomials, where only a finite number of terms are non-zero,
 is a polynomial.
 To go beyond this, to get to more general functions, such as, for example,
 a sum over monomials with an infinite number of non-zero elements, requires
 the introduction of a topology on the infinite vector space, so that limits
 of Cauchy sequences can be defined and discussed.
 There are several ways to provide a topology; the straightforward way is
 to provide the space with a metric topology.
 A metric topology endows the infinite vector space with a norm, so that
 the length of a vector can be given, and the distance between vectors defined
 as the length of the vector difference.
 Metrics or norms provide a particularly easy way of discussing the convergence
 of limits.
\end_layout

With this in mind, the question then turns to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what are the interesting topologies?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Before this question is asked in earnest, it is worth illustrating why,
 exactly, it is an important question, and why the role of topologies needs
 to be addressed.
 Some of the difficulties of sticking to a purely algebraic approach are
 illustrated in this section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|B_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{B}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 was shown to be algebraically complete on the space of polynomials.
 By this, it is meant that there is no polynomial that lies in the kernel
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

, other than the trivial polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, there does not exist any polynomial for which the identity
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=-p(x+1/2)$
\end_inset

 holds: more broadly, there is no such thing as a periodic polynomial.
 A function which obeys 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=-f(x+1/2)$
\end_inset

 is of necessity periodic, of which 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\sin(2\pi x)$
\end_inset

 is a canonical example.
 More generally, sine and cosine waves which have an odd number of periods
 in the unit interval are all in the kernel of the Bernoulli operator, when
 that operator is taken in the coordinate-space.
 This may be seen very easily simply by direct substitution into equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli operator"

\end_inset

, which promptly yields 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Coordinate}}\sin2\pi(2k+1)x=\frac{1}{2}\left[\sin\pi(2k+1)x+\sin\pi(2k+1)(x+1)\right]=0\label{eq:Coordinate kernel}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

; likewise for the cosine.
 Not so for waves with an even number of periods: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Coordinate}}\sin4\pi kx=\frac{1}{2}\left[\sin2\pi kx+\sin2\pi k(x+1)\right]=\sin2\pi kx\]

\end_inset

Here, the superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coordinate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is introduced to distinguish the operator in the coordinate basis, as given
 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli operator"

\end_inset

, from the same operator in the monomial basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a previous section, it was established that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}}=\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Monomial}}$
\end_inset

, when these are considered as operators acting on the space of polynomials.
 However, these are not at all equivalent if one considers them as operators
 acting on sines and cosines.
 In particular, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\exp2\pi ikx$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathbb{I}_{B}f\right](x)= & \left\langle x\left|\mathbb{I}_{B}\right|f\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|B_{n}\right.\right\rangle \left\langle \left.\tilde{B}_{n}\right|f\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|B_{n}\right.\right\rangle \frac{1}{n!}\left[f^{(n-1)}(1)-f^{(n-1)}(0)\right]+\int_{0}^{1}f\left(x\right)dx\\
= & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|B_{n}\right.\right\rangle \frac{1}{n!}\left[(2\pi ik)^{n-1}e^{2\pi ik}-(2\pi ik)^{n-1}\right]\\
= & 0\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the second step makes use of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:B-tilde acting on f"

\end_inset

.
 This is remarkable, as any periodic wave constructed from sines and cosines
 seems to be in the kernel.
 By contrast, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{M}$
\end_inset

 does not behave this way:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[\mathbb{I}_{M}f\right](x)= & \left\langle x\left|\mathbb{I}_{M}\right|f\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|n\right.\right\rangle \left\langle \left.n\right|f\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|n\right.\right\rangle \frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(0)\\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left\langle x\left|n\right.\right\rangle \frac{1}{n!}(2\pi ik)^{n}\\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{n}\frac{1}{n!}(2\pi ik)^{n}\\
= & \exp2\pi ikx\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is just a re-derivation of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Taylors bra-kets"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{M}$
\end_inset

 are inequivalent when acting on sine functions; so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Monomial}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}}$
\end_inset

 are inequivalent as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the sine function is the limit of a polynomial sequence, it seems
 strange or somehow contradictory that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}^{\mbox{Bernoulli}}$
\end_inset

 has only a trivial kernel on the space of polynomials, while killing odd-period
 sine and cosine functions.
 In order to define limits, or more precisely, in order to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin2\pi x$
\end_inset

 as the limit of a sequence of polynomials, one must define the manner in
 which a polynomial sequence can converge to a function, and, for that,
 one must have a topology.
 This conundrum is revisited, and solved, in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Kernel on L_2"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can this conundrum be escaped without appealing to topology? Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{B}$
\end_inset

 seems to be somehow incomplete when considering sine functions, perhaps,
 one might think, this lack of completeness is due to the form of the left
 eigenstates given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:left bernoulli"

\end_inset

.
 One might make a guess that perhaps a more truly complete set of states
 can be found by considering 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{S}_{n}(x)=\frac{(-)^{n+1}}{n!}\left[\delta^{(n-1)}(1-x)+\delta^{(n-1)}(x)\right]\]

\end_inset

so that sums and differences of the duals 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}_{m}(x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 can be used to regain the duals to the monomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|y\right\rangle =(-)^{n}\delta^{(n)}(y)/n!$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem*
The duals to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(x)=nE_{n}(x)/2$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 are the Euler polynomials.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Consider the generating function for the Euler polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{E}(x,t)=\frac{2e^{xt}}{1+e^{t}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}E_{n}(x)\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\]

\end_inset

Then one has, by taking the left hand side, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\,\frac{2e^{xt}}{1+e^{t}}\, dx=\frac{2}{n}\frac{t^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\]

\end_inset

and, performing the same operation on the right hand side, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}E_{k}(x)\frac{t^{k}}{k!}\; dx=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k!}\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\, E_{k}(x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

Then, equating the two sides, one has demonstrated duality of these states:
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\, E_{k}(x)\, dx=\frac{2\delta_{k,n-1}}{n}\]

\end_inset

which completes the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with the Bernoulli polynomials, one can, to a limit extent, make a restricted
 completeness statement in coordinate space.
 That is, if one decomposes a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}S_{k}(y)$
\end_inset

 then one easily finds 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}S_{n}(x)\tilde{S}_{n}(y)\, f(y)\, dy=f(x)\]

\end_inset

from which one wants to conclude, once again incorrectly, or at least misleading
ly, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}S_{n}(x)\tilde{S}_{n}(y)=\delta(x-y)\]

\end_inset

by repeating the same concerns and issues that lead to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Bernoulli-faulty"

\end_inset

.
 The fault is the assumption that arbitrary, non-polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed in the fashion given.
 In fact, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{S}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|S_{n}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{S}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 also has a large kernel: this time, all functions that are evenly periodic
 are in the kernel.
 That is, any function for which one has 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)=f(y+1/2)$
\end_inset

 lies in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{S}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might hope that one can remedy the above situation by taking the sum
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{C}=\mathbb{I}_{B}+\mathbb{I}_{S}$
\end_inset

 with one operator projecting out the even periodic functions, and the other
 the odd periodic functions, and that somehow, between the two of them,
 making a whole.
 However, one immediately runs into a problem with the basis functions.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 are not orthogonal to the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

, and vice-versa.
 This is easily seen by considering the the generating function for the
 Bernoulli polynomials: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
G_{B}(x,t)=\frac{te^{xt}}{e^{t}-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}(x)\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\]

\end_inset

Integrating, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)G_{B}(x,t)\, dx=\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\frac{e^{t}+1}{e^{t}-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k!}\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\, B_{k}(x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

However, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{S}_{n}(x)\, B_{k}(x)\, dx=0$
\end_inset

 only for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n-1$
\end_inset

, and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\tilde{B}_{n}(x)\, S_{k}(x)\, dx$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, any such attempt to patch up the situation is doomed to
 fail.
 In essence, we are looking for a basis such that every point in the space
 is a linear combination of a finite number of basis vectors.
 Such a basis is called an algebraic or Hamel basis.
 But the number of limit points in the space are uncountable, and so the
 Hamel basis cannot be countable
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In such a situation, the basis vectors can't be bi-orthogonal.

\begin_layout Section
The Fourier Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explored above, the Bernoulli operator is clearly quite different on
 the completion of the space of polynomials than it is on the space of polynomia
ls itself.
 At this point, it would be nice to have a discussion how one might create
 completions of the space of polynomials, how many of these are distinct,
 and what their different properties might be.
 [XXX ToDo, do the above, at least in some appendix or something].
 However, at this point, we make an ansatz, and jump to one reasonable space
 that can fill the bill: the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions
 on the unit interval.
 This is a well-known, familiar space widely studied in textbooks, and so
 is a suitable setting for further analysis of the Bernoulli operator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows, many of the properties of this space will not be required
 or appealed to.
 The only important ingredient we'll make use of is that this space has
 a basis spanned by the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin2\pi nx$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos2\pi nx$
\end_inset

 for positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Also, keep in mind that, in general, an element of this space is not differenti
able or even continuous (the square wave is a textbook example, although,
 below, we'll construct the Cantor curve, which is an element of this space,
 but is discontinuous at all dyadic rationals).
 Elements of this space are also not bounded, but may diverge to infinity.
 From the physics viewpoint, this means that this space contains many 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non-physical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functions.
 So, for example, in physical systems, the kinetic energy commonly appears
 as the square of the derivative; when a function is discontinuous, the
 kinetic energy is effectively infinite.
 So, in order to stick to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 systems.
 one should properly have defined some sort of metric on the polynomials
 that somehow took into account their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kinetic energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then used this to define the completion of the space.
 We save this task for some rainy day.

Applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 as defined in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The doubling of the Bernoulli map 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 manifests itself as a doubling of the coefficient indexes.
 In bra-ket notation, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle em\left|\mathcal{L}_{B}\right|en\right\rangle =\delta_{m,2n}$
\end_inset

, where we use the abbreviated notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|en\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to stand for 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos2\pi nx$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin2\pi nx$
\end_inset

, as appropriate.
 Writing this out in matrix form, the Bernoulli operator has the distinctive
 form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{B}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & ...\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\

\end_inset

with every other column consisting entirely of zeros.
 Clearly, this operator is quite singular, and has a large kernel.

The Koopman operator of the Bernoulli Map has the property of taking a function
 and making two copies of it.
 Working from it's definition, the Koopman operator is given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

= & \sum_{\forall x:x=b\left(y\right)}f\left(x\right)\\

\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x)$

 Acting on the Fourier series

\end_inset

or, in Dirac notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle em\left|\mathcal{K}_{B}\right|en\right\rangle =\delta_{2m,n}$
\end_inset

 In matrix form, it has the visual appearance of 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

where every other row consists of zeros.
 It is obvious that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 is literally the transpose: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{B}=\mathcal{L}_{B}^{T}$
\end_inset

 in this basis.
 Also quite evident is that, just as in the coordinate-space representation,
 one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}\mathcal{K}_{B}=1$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{B}\mathcal{L}_{B}\neq1$

 The Koopman operator is the right-inverse for the Bernoulli operator, but
 it is not the left-inverse.
 In fact,

Assume that there exists an operator

 Then, by associativity of operator multiplication, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}\cdot1=\mathcal{M}\cdot\left(\mathcal{L}_{B}\mathcal{K}_{B}\right)=\left(\mathcal{ML}_{B}\right)\cdot\mathcal{K}_{B}=1\cdot\mathcal{K}_{B}=\mathcal{K}_{B}\]

\end_inset

which is clearly false.
 Thus, such an

 does not exist.
\end_layout

 Put in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $PB_{n}\ne0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbb{I}-P\right)B_{n}\ne B_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 This seems surprising, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 are eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}B_{n}=\lambda_{n}B_{n}$
\end_inset

 and it is not uncommon that eigenvectors are orthogonal to the kernel.
 However, this need not be the case.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}=PB_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=\left(\mathbb{I}-P\right)B_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}=b_{n}+k_{n}$
\end_inset

, one then has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}k_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}b_{n}=\lambda_{n}\left(b_{n}+v_{n}\right)$

 The Bernoulli operator acts in a skew fashion, twisting a portion of each
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 into the kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's more, this skewness now 'explains' an earlier mystery.
 It was noted earlier that no polynomial lies in the kernel; this leads
 all too easily to the false assumption that every polynomial lies entirely
 within 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 This mistaken assumption then leads to counter-intuitive results, such
 has how the sequence of the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 can converge to something that is non-zero, yet also within the kernel.
 This in turn confuses the question of what the completion of the polynomials
 must be like.
 This can now be resolved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, for example, one has the Cauchy sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\left(x\right)\to\cos2\pi x$
\end_inset

 (when the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 are properly normalized).
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 are closed; that is, the limit of a Cauchy sequence in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $K)$
\end_inset

 is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 (respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $K)$
\end_inset

.
 Insofar as the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 seems to be in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, while clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\in K$
\end_inset

, the Cauchy sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\to\cos$
\end_inset

 appears to contradict the closure.
 But this is only appearance; the faulty assumption was that the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 lie entirely within 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 So, let 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\mathbb{I}-P$
\end_inset

.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 are bounded operators, and thus continuous.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is continuous, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $QB_{n}\to Q\cos$
\end_inset

, likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $PB_{n}\to P\cos$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\cos=0$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\in K$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P\cos=\cos$
\end_inset

.
 So one has, at last, that 
\begin_inset Formula $QB_{n}\to0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $PB_{n}\to\cos$
\end_inset

.
 There is not one Cauchy sequence, but two, and both now converge as expected.
 The space of polynomials overlaps both 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, as does it's completion.

The above theorem holds in general for shift operators on Hilbert spaces.
 In our case, it is instructive to see how it plays out.
 We have, of course,

 The projection operator 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 The operator

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin2^{n+1}\pi\left(2j+1\right)x$

 That this is the entire space, and that the decomposition is unique, follows
 from the fact that any integer

\begin_inset Formula $N=2^{n}\left(2j+1\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{p}\mathcal{L}_{p}^{n}$

This same decomposition, but viewed from a different angle, recurs again,
 in a later section, in the construction and analysis of the 'fractal' spectrum
 of the Bernoulli operator.
 This time, the powers of 2 will be understood to be moves on the dyadic
 tree, with the Cantor set appearing as the limit of the dyadic tree, and
 the fractal self-symmetry following there-from.
 The take-away lesson here is, perhaps, that any system with a shift operator
 and/or an infinite Cartesian product of spaces will exhibit eigenfunctions
 with fractal-type symmetry.
 The self-symmetry arises purely from the interplay between the shift and
 the kernel.

The Bernoulli operator has a continuous spectrum, when considered in the
 space of square-integrable functions.
 The eigenvectors are quite degenerate, in that there is a countable infinity
 of eigenvectors associated with one eigenvalue.
 The degeneracy allows the eigenvectors to be combined in any of a variety
 of ways; different linear combinations have different properties, each
 interesting in its own way.
 In what follows, we will first present the Hurwitz zeta eigenfunctions.
 These generalize the Bernoulli polynomials, and, like the polynomials,
 are more or less

 and differentiable, at least away from the endpoints.
 An alternate linear combination will be presented in a later section: The
 Hurwitz zeta eigenfunctions can be re-summed to yield fractal curves, which
 are differentiable nowhere (well, strictly speaking, non-differentiable
 on the dyadic rationals).
 Each basis offers it's own insights.

 associated with the eigenvalue

 In coordinate space, one may write these eigenfunctions as

An important concluding remark is in order: these eigenfunctions are defined
 on the entire complex

 The spectrum lying inside the unit disk

 corresponds to the right side of the complex plane: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>0$
\end_inset

 (for the Hurwitz zeta, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s<1$

 Now, because these functions are well-defined, and even analytic, for the
 entire plane, we effectively have a family of eigenfunctions for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|>1$
\end_inset

, although these will not be integrable, due to singularities at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,1$
\end_inset

 This is notable because most general treatments of transfer operators,

 limit themselves to the space 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 of integrable functions, and thus discover a spectrum on the unit disk
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|\le1$

 The point here is that the spectrum need not stop at the unit disk; it
 can be larger, provided one expands the space of allowable functions.

 Writing

 One may take linear combinations of eigenvectors in this family.

In later sections, it will be seen the Bernoulli operator also has fractal
 eigenvectors.
 Some of these may be written as linear combinations of of the zeta eigenvectors

 This begs several questions: are all linear combinations of the zetas that
 require an infinite series fractal? Or are there infinite linear combinations
 that are smooth? Is the set of smooth solutions connected or disconnected?
 Are the connected components simply connected or not? Answers to these
 questions are not immediately apparent.

A curious squaring:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}e^{2\pi iyp}\mathcal{L}_{p}\right]\beta(x;s)=\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{2\pi iyp}}{p^{s}}\beta(x;s)=\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{2\Gamma(s+1)}\,\beta(y;s)\beta(x;s)\]

\end_inset

Because the operators are multiplicative, Euler products

 may be taken.
 Thus, for example, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}(1)=\zeta\left(s\right)$

, while factoring the summation into primes yields 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\prod_{p\mbox{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-\mathcal{L}_{p}}\beta(x;s)=\zeta(s)\beta(x;s)\]

\end_inset

The product is taken only over prime numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 One may likewise consider any of the other typical Euler products encountered
 in number theory.
 Defining the operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{Z}=\prod_{p\mbox{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-\mathcal{L}_{p}}\]

\end_inset

one then has the curious situation that the vectors in the kernel of

With considerably more difficulty, one might envision operators constructed

 In particular, the shift operator gets a more concrete interpretation as

Consider a one-sided lattice of points, labeled by the positive integers,
 that is, by 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$

 values, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}\in\left\{ 0,1,2,\cdots,p-1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The space of states of the lattice is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=p\times p\times\cdots=p^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 where we write 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv\left\{ 0,1,2,\cdots,p-1\right\} $
\end_inset

, letting the number stand for the set.
 A given lattice configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)\in\Omega$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be either a 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic number, or as a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $x:\Omega\to[0,1]$

 given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x(\sigma)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sigma_{n}p^{-n}\label{eq:Cantor mapping}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This mapping allows every possible spin lattice configuration to be mapped
 into the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

, although not vice-versa: the natural topology on the spin lattice is finer
 than the natural topology on the reals, in that, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=(0,1,1,\cdots)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,0,0,\cdots)$
\end_inset

 are inequivalent lattice configurations, whereas the binary numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0111\ldots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1000\ldots$
\end_inset

 both represent the rational 1/2.
 Only certain rationals are double-pointed like this, whereas all irrationals
 correspond to a unique lattice configuration.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$

 Since the one-dimensional lattice is the Cartesian product of an infinite
 number of finite sets, the product topology applies.
 In fact, the product topology will prove very nice to work with; it is
 a reasonably coarse topology, yet, it is compatible with the natural topology
 on the reals.
 One particularly strong utility of the product topology is that it enables
 the definition and discussion of measurable (integrable) functions that
 are discontinuous at all rational numbers; by contrast, such constructions
 are extremely awkward when using Fourier series, and, of course, impossible
 in the language of analysis.
 We'll construct many such functions here; in what follows, the product
 topology will be made great use of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product topology allows a set of fractal eigenfunctions to be constructed
 for the Bernoulli operator.
 One begins by noting that the left-shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 on the lattice, defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(\sigma)=\tau((\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots))=(\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3},\cdots)\]

\end_inset

corresponds exactly to the Bernoulli map: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x(\tau(\sigma))=2x(\sigma)-\left\lfloor 2x(\sigma)\right\rfloor \]

\end_inset

where we've written 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\sigma)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to help remind that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 should be thought of as a map, not a real number.
 For the remainder of this section, this distinction will rarely be made
 again, although every occurrence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{x}$
\end_inset

 should be implicitly understood to be the map 
\begin_inset Formula $x:\Omega\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now some arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $V:\Omega\to F$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 may be taken to be the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, or some arbitrary general field.
 Then, given some 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in F$
\end_inset

, one may construct the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H(\sigma)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}V(\tau^{n}\sigma)\label{eq:Lattice Hamlitonian}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{n}\sigma=(\tau\circ\tau\circ\cdots\circ\tau)(\sigma)$
\end_inset

 is simply the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold iteration of the shift operator.
 In physics, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is usually called the translation-invariant Hamiltonian for the system,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the interaction potential.
 For a one-sided lattice, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is not strictly translation invariant, as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H(\tau(\sigma))=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}V(\tau^{n+1}\sigma)=\frac{H(\sigma)-V(\sigma)}{\lambda}\label{eq:Hamiltonian left shift}\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Almost, because the one-sided lattice introduces a correction 
\begin_inset Formula $V/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 For the bi-infinite, two-sided lattice, a truly translation-invariant Hamiltoni
an can be defined.
 The two-sided lattice model corresponds to the Bakers map, and is treated
 in greater detail in section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the left-shift operator, then the analog of the transfer operator can
 be roughly taken to be the right-shift operator.
 Since the lattice is one-sided, there exist in fact 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in-equivalent right-shift operators 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{k}(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)=(k,\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\cdots)\label{eq:Lattice right-shift}\end{equation}

\end_inset

These right-shift operators are inverses to the left shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 only on one side, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\circ S_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the identity, but 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}\circ\tau$
\end_inset

 is not.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 has no left-inverse, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 throws away data in its action.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

 case, the shift operators act on the Cantor mapping as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
x(S_{0}(\sigma))= & \frac{x(\sigma)}{2}\\
x(S_{1}(\sigma))= & \frac{1+x(\sigma)}{2}\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so one may immediately recognize how to pose the Bernoulli operator
 on the lattice model.
 For some arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\Omega\to F$
\end_inset

 one defines 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}f\right](\sigma)=\frac{1}{2}\left[f(S_{0}(\sigma))+f(S_{1}(\sigma))\right]\]

\end_inset

For the general 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic case, this generalizes trivially:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
The 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic Bernoulli operator acting on the space of functionals of lattice configura
tions is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{p}f\right](\sigma)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}f\left(S_{k}(\sigma)\right)\label{eq:Lattice Bernoulli}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th right-shift operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{p}$
\end_inset

 on the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is takes the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{p}H=\mathcal{L}_{p}V+\lambda H\label{eq:Lattice shift eigenfunction}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is easily shown by direct substitution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The critical result here is that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{p}V=0$
\end_inset

.
 Curiously, this implies that functions in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 can be used to construct eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The above construction is not limited the the Bernoulli operator, but clearly
 is a general result: it is essentially the Wold decomposition of section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Wold-decomposition"

\end_inset

, but restated in a a more general form: rather than requiring a Hilbert
 space, it holds for arbitrary Cartesian products over arbitrary spaces,
 provided only that the summation in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is convergent (and/or meets any other criteria for the space being worked).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Using equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to regain the natural topology on the real numbers, one may use the constructio

 This is done explicitly in this section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, it was seen that the kernel of the Bernoulli operator consists of the
 odd harmonics of sine and cosine: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{B}\sin2\pi(2k+1)x & =0\\
\mathcal{L}_{B}\cos2\pi(2k+1)x & =0\end{align*}

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a non-negative integer parametrizing the kernel; however, it will be
 more convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp2\pi i\left(2k+1\right)x$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 rang e over all integers, positive and negative.
 A simple linear combination over positive and negative 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 will regain the real form.
 Inserting these into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lattice Hamlitonian"

\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}\exp\left(2\pi\left(2k+1\right)\tau^{n}x\right)\]

\end_inset

which is an eigenfunction: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}H=\lambda H$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp$
\end_inset

 is periodic, we may replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}x$
\end_inset

.
 Switching notation, one has a collection of eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\phi_{\lambda,k}^{B}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}\exp\left(2\pi i\;2^{n}\left(2k+1\right)x\right)\label{eq:dyadic exp fractal}\end{equation}

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
 This derivation allows 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in F$
\end_inset

 for any field 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

; taking 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to be the complex numbers, the sum converges absolutely for the disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and conditionally for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|=1$

 is a root of unity or not.

 which clearly obey 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{p}\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}=\lambda\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These eigenfunctions are highly degenerate, and span an infinite-dimensional
 space labeled by 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Any linear combination of these is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue.
 These clearly form a continuous spectrum for the Bernoulli operator, although,
 strictly speaking, this spectrum is defined only on the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
 This is in contrast to the zeta eigenfunctions, which are defined for the
 entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

-plane (although these are not integrable when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|>1$
\end_inset

).
 This implies that the construction of eigenfunctions by means of lattice
 shifts is somehow innately limited: it allows some, but not all possible
 eigenfunctions to be found.
 The true nature of this obstruction is unclear.
 The proximal cause of the obstruction is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\lambda^{n}=1/(1-\lambda)$
\end_inset

 has a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, thus preventing the convergence of the analytic series beyond that point.
 However, in the more global view, one has an operator acting on an infinite-dim
ensional topological vector space; whether the obstruction is due to the
 operator or the structure of the space itself is unclear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Unlike the zeta function eigenvectors, these eigenvectors are not infinitely

 Taking the first derivative, one has

\end_inset

and so the right hand side converges absolutely only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1/p$

 For

Clearly, any linear combination of only a finite number of these fractal
 eigenfunctions will posses similar analytic properties.
 However, there is an infinite series combination of these that does reproduce
 the zeta function eigenfunctions.
 An explicit relationship between these two is developed in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Fractal Spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fractal spectrum can be re-expressed in terms of the zeta eigenfunctions,
 and vice-versa.
 That is, the one set of eigenfunctions can be expressed as linear combinations
 of the other.
 This section gives the explicit linear relations connecting the one to
 the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The establishment of this result is the observation that every integer has
 a unique factorization in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $(pk+r)p^{n}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $k,r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 uniquely determined when 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 This leads to a summation identity: for a fixed integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, and some arbitrary summable function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(n)$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\;\sum_{r=1}^{p-1}\;\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\; f\left((pk+r)p^{m}\right)\]

\end_inset

The summand of the triple sum on the right is precisely of the form appearing
 in the fractal eigenfunctions, whereas the left-hand side is of the simpler
 form of the zeta eigenfunctions.
 The desired linear relationship is obtained merely by matching terms in
 the series.
 That is, one sets 
\begin_inset Formula $f(n)=2\Gamma(s+1)\,(2\pi n)^{-s}\exp(2\pi ixn)$
\end_inset

 to immediately obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\beta(x;s) & = & \frac{2\Gamma(s+1)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\;\sum_{r=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{(pk+r)^{s}}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{\exp2\pi ix(pk+r)p^{m}}{p^{ms}}\\
 & = & \frac{2\Gamma(s+1)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\;\sum_{r=1}^{p-1}\frac{1}{(pk+r)^{s}}\,\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}(x)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where one identifies 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=p^{-s}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full set of zeta eigenfunctions, accounting for degeneracy, is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta_{n}(x;s)\equiv\beta(x;s+2\pi ni/\ln2)\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{Z}.$
\end_inset

 These share the same eigenvalue: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{p}\beta_{n}=p^{-s}\beta_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The relevant values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 should be restricted to a principal domain 
\begin_inset Formula $-\pi<\Im s\,\ln2=\arg\, z<\pi$
\end_inset

 .
 Repeating the above manipulations, the goal is to write the zetas as a
 linear combination of the fractal eigenfunctions, so: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta_{n}(x;s)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\;\sum_{r=1}^{p-1}F_{nkr}\,\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}(x)\]

\end_inset

These matrix elements are
\begin_inset Formula \[
F_{nkr}=2\Gamma\left(s+1+\frac{2\pi ni}{\ln2}\right)\left(2\pi(pk+r)\right)^{-s}\exp\left[-2n\pi i\frac{\ln\pi(pk+r)}{\ln2}\right]\]

\end_inset

Presumably 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is invertible; the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}$
\end_inset

 should be expressible in terms of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{n}(x;s)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analytic situation is curious: the zeta eigenfunctions are well-defined
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|>1$
\end_inset

, even as the fractal eigenfunctions are not.
 The change-of-basis summations clearly appear to be divergent as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|$
\end_inset

 approaches 1.
 It would appear that the zeta eigenfunctions span a larger space than the
 fractal eigenfunctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discontinuous eigenfunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the eigenfunctions are not continuous in the natural topology of
 the reals.
 Thus, for example, given the expansion in binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{b_{n}}{2^{n+1}}\]

\end_inset

Then the Cantor or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Devil's staircase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{\lambda}\left(x\right)=\lambda\left(\lambda-1\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{b_{n}}\lambda^{n}\]

\end_inset

is easily shown to be an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 This function is clearly discontinuous for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 except 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\lambda}\left(x\right)=B_{1}\left(x\right)=x-1/2$

This eigenfunction is not 'new', but is rather a linear combination of those
 already presented.
 To see this, generalize the construction.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\lambda,k,r}^{(p)}(x)$
\end_inset

 were built up explicitly from sine waves, but there is no particular reason
 to start with a sine-wave basis for the kernel.
 Consider, for example, the square wave or Haar wavelet 
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(x)=\begin{cases}
+1 & \mbox{ for }0\le x<1/2\\
-1 & \mbox{ for }1/2\le x<1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

extended to the entire real-number line as a periodic function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x+n)=h(x)$
\end_inset

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The Haar wavelet is in the kernel of the Bernoulli operator: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}h(x)=0$
\end_inset

, and thus can be used to create a fractal eigenfunction by means of the
 lattice shift equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lattice shift eigenfunction"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\psi_{k}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}h\left((2k+1)2^{n}x\right)\label{eq:Haar wavelet eigenfunction}\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}\psi_{k}=\lambda\psi_{k}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset

 in the unit disk.
 Of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a special case: 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\lambda}\left(x\right)=\lambda\left(\lambda-1\right)\psi_{0}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, and so we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of the functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dyadic exp fractal"

\end_inset

.
 By the Fourier decomposition theorem, 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 periodic function odd about 1/2 will consist entirely of odd harmonics,
 and can thus be used to define an eigenfunction in the manner of eqn
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Haar wavelet eigenfunction"

\end_inset

.
 That it is a linear combination of the basis vectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dyadic exp fractal"

\end_inset

 follows trivially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few practical reasons for choosing a basis other than the sine-wave
 basis.
 Most notably, convergence properties are altered: the Haar wavelet can
 avoid the Gibbs phenomenon of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ringing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that makes absolute bounds difficult to establish.
 The Haar wavelet also seems more compatible with the product topology of
 the lattice; it has a particularly simple form when considered as a function
 on the lattice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, incidentally, that even more 'horrible' eigenfunctions can be constructed
 in this fashion.
 Consider, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(x-\frac{1}{4}\right)-\delta\left(x-\frac{3}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

, extended to be periodic on the real line.
 It may be expressed as a Fourier series; it lies in the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 It may be used to create a fractal eigenfunction: integrable but not square-int
egrable and certainly not bounded, thus showing that there are eigenfunctions
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 that are in 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 but not in 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 This foreshadows some of the more challenging functions one encounters
 when analyzing other transfer operators, such as the GKW operator
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-GKW"

\end_inset

.
 It also vindicates the focus on measurable functions on the product topology:
 the Dirac delta function is far easier to 'understand' as a measure on
 a topology than as a Fourier series.

\begin_layout Subsection
Fractal Symmetry and the Dyadic Monoid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fractal eigenfunctions are self-similar.
 This self-similarity follows directly from the shift invariance of the
 lattice construction, that is, of the translation invariance of the lattice
 Hamiltonian embodied in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Hamiltonian left shift"

\end_inset

.
 Loosely speaking, one might say that translation-invariant Hamiltonians
 must necessarily have fractal eigenfunctions.
 The self-similarities have a non-trivial structure, which is exposed in
 this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For concreteness, consider first the action of the right-sift operators
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

, defined by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lattice right-shift"

\end_inset

, acting on the 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

 dyadic eigenfunction 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Haar wavelet eigenfunction"

\end_inset

 built from the Haar wavelet.
 One has (dropping the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 from
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left[S_{0}\cdot\psi\right](x) & = & \psi\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}h\left(2^{n-1}x\right)\\
 & = & h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda^{n-1}h\left(2^{n-1}x\right)\\
 & = & h\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda\psi(x)\\
 & = & -1+\lambda\psi(x)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

with the last step following because the Haar wavelet is identically -1
 on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<1/2$
\end_inset

.
 To emphasize this, write it more simply as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=-1+\lambda\psi(x)\]

\end_inset

That is, one very explicitly has that the eigenfunction on the whole unit
 interval looks exactly like the eigenfunction on the half-interval, except
 that its scaled and offset: this is classic fractal self-similarity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the other shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

, one readily obtains that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}\psi=1+\lambda\psi$
\end_inset

.
 The action of these two shift operators has a representation in terms of
 2x2 matrices acting on two-dimensional vectors.
 The basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

 for this vector space are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
1\mapsto e_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{ and }\quad\psi\mapsto e_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset

one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & -1\\
0 & \lambda\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & \lambda\end{array}\right]\label{eq:Dyadic generators}\end{equation}

\end_inset

so that one has, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}e_{1}=-e_{0}+\lambda e_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the action of the right shift on this vector space.
 The two matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 generate a monoid, the 
\emph on
dyadic monoid
\emph default
.
 A general element 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the monoid is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=S_{0}^{n_{0}}S_{1}^{n_{1}}S_{0}^{n_{2}}S_{1}^{n_{3}}\cdots\]

\end_inset

for non-negative integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 .
 The monoid is free, in that there are no relations between 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

, and each unique string of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},\cdots$
\end_inset

 results in a unique element of the monoid.
 For the purpose of this text, a 
\emph on
monoid
\emph default
 is defined much as a group, except that inverses are not considered.
 This is for two reasons: first, the inverses of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 are not uniquely defined: the left and right inverse differ.
 Secondly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is to be understood to be the action of a monoid element acting on the
 unit interval.
 As long as the action maps the whole interval into a sub-interval, the
 action is well-defined; however, there are technical difficulties with
 going in the reverse direction.

\begin_layout Standard
The dyadic monoid has many interesting properties; these are discussed in
 greater detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-T04"

\end_inset

.
 Among the notable properties is that the dyadic monoid is isomorphic to
 a certain subset of the Modular Group; this connection alone being important
 as the modular group plays an important role in number theory, specifically
 in the area of modular forms and automorphic forms.
 Not inconsequential is that the theory of modular forms again borders on
 the theory of the Riemann zeta.
 In a similar vein, one notes that the string of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $[n_{0},n_{1},n_{2},\cdots]$
\end_inset

 is isomorphic to a continued fraction.
 Continued fractions are important both to the theory of Diophantine equations
 (Pellian equations), and in turn are seen to tie back into general phenomena
 seen in ergodic dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integral of the Haar wavelet or square wave is the tent map or triangle
 wave
\begin_inset Formula \[
t(x)=\int_{0}^{x}h(y)\, dy=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{1}{2}-2x & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x\leq1/2\\
-\frac{3}{2}+2x & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x\leq1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

This is extended to the entire real line by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $t(x+n)=t(x)$
\end_inset

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The triangle wave has the curious property of period-doubling upon iteration:
 that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{k}(x)=-t(2^{k-1}x)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>1$
\end_inset

.
 The iterated tent map behaves as a shift state, in that the Bernoulli operator
 acts as an annihilation operator: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}t^{k}\right](x)=t^{k-1}(x)\]

\end_inset

with the shift terminating at 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}t\right](x)=0\]

\end_inset

The fractal eigenfunction constructed from the triangle wave is the Takagi
 or blancmange curve: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{\lambda}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}t(2^{n}x)\]

\end_inset

and so of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}b_{\lambda}=\lambda b_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 There is a curious special case: the Takagi curve 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1/4}(x)$
\end_inset

 is a parabola, corresponding to the Bernoulli polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Apparently, the construction of the parabola by self-similar subdivision
 was known to Archimedes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blancmange curve transforms under a three-dimensional representation
 as the Haar-wavelet curve, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{0}b_{\lambda}=-\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\lambda b_{\lambda}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S_{1}b_{\lambda}=\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\lambda b_{\lambda}\]

\end_inset

Taking as the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
1\mapsto e_{0} & = & \left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0\\
0\end{array}\right]\\
x\mapsto e_{1} & = & \left[\begin{array}{c}

0\end{array}\right]\\
b_{\lambda}\mapsto e_{2} & = & \left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
1\end{array}\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

the two generators may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & \frac{1}{2}\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2}\\
0 & 0 & \lambda\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2}\\
0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2}\\
0 & 0 & \lambda\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process can be extended arbitrarily.
 One may choose to integrate the triangle wave, or to make a more general
 ansatz.
 Given some arbitrary polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

, one may fashion a piece-wise polynomial periodic wave 
\begin_inset Formula \[
q(x)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
-p(x) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 0\leq x<1/2\\
p\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \;\textrm{ when }\; & 1/2\leq x<1\end{array}\right.\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x+1/2)=-q(x)$
\end_inset

 or equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}q\right](x)=0$
\end_inset

.
 From this, one constructs the fractal wave 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f_{\lambda}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}q(2^{n}x)\]

\end_inset

which transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{0}f_{\lambda}=-p\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda f_{\lambda}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S_{1}f_{\lambda}=p\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda f_{\lambda}\]

\end_inset

If the degree of the polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, then the associated linear representation is 
\begin_inset Formula $m+2$
\end_inset

 dimensional.
 One may choose as the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}=x^{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\le m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{m+1}=f_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 are obtained by expanding the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x/2)$
\end_inset

 in terms of the chosen basis.
 There is nothing special about the monomial basis; one might consider any
 basis where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 represents a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As should be clear from the above construction, when 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x)$
\end_inset

 is not a polynomial, the representation cannot be finite-dimensional.
 In particular, the sine-wave based dyadic fractal 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset Formula $q(x)=\exp2\pi ix$

\begin_inset Formula $k\ne0$

\begin_inset Formula \[
f_{\lambda,k}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}q\left(2^{n}\left(2k+1\right)x\right)\]

\end_inset

does not change the situation.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{B}q\right](x)=0$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x+1/2)=-q(x)$
\end_inset

, and so again, the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{0}f_{\lambda,k}=q\left((2k+1)\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda f_{\lambda,k}\quad\mbox{ and }\quad S_{1}f_{\lambda,k}=-q\left((2k+1)\frac{x}{2}\right)+\lambda f_{\lambda,k}\]

\end_inset

As before, if 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x)$
\end_inset

 is made from a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, the resulting fractal function transforms under an 
\begin_inset Formula $m+2$

 dimensional linear representation.

 may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[T_{p}f\right]\left(\tau\right)=p^{m-1}f\left(p\tau\right)+\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}f\left(\frac{\tau+k}{p}\right)\]

\end_inset

In number theory, the Hecke operator is used in the classification of modular
 forms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Now, in number theory, the above is intended to act only on functions meromorph
ic in the upper-half complex plane; 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 lies in the upper half of the complex plane.
 However, we can immediately recognize the Hecke operator as the sum of
 the Bernoulli operator and its transpose: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{p}=p^{m-1}\mathcal{K}_{p}+\mathcal{L}_{p}\]

\end_inset

and so a certain form of the Hecke operator may be defined as acting on
 the unit interval and/or the Cantor set with the product topology.
 XXX expand, clarify.

The two-sided lattice is the lattice that stretches off to both the left

 The state of the two-sided lattice may be represented by two numbers

 The energy is a simple sum of the energy of the half-lattices to the left

 The probability density is a product of the probability densities on the

The shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be understood to be an operator that pops a bit off the right-hand
 half lattice, and pushes it onto the left half-lattice.
 In the dyadic notation, it can be recognized as the so-called 
\emph on
Baker's map
\emph default
, a map from the unit square onto itself that cuts the square into two pieces,
 and stacks and squashes them.
 That is, given a pair of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 in the unit square, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau(x,y)=\left(\frac{x+\left\lfloor 2y\right\rfloor }{2}\,,\,2y-\left\lfloor 2y\right\rfloor \right)\]

\end_inset

The Baker's map can be studied in its own right as a discrete-time dynamical
 system, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 can be taken to define the time evolution of a unit square over a single
 time-step.
 The time evolution is invertible, in that the inverse map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely defined, being 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau^{-1}(x,y)=\left(2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \,,\,\frac{y+\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor }{2}\right)\]

\end_inset

The inverse map can be seen to be identical to the forward map with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 interchanged: that is, translation to the left on the lattice is identical
 to translation to the right, with left and right exchanged.
 One may say the map is 
\begin_inset Formula $PT$
\end_inset

-symmetric, with 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 standing for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
The two-sided lattice may be studied either as a lattice model, or as a
 dynamical system with time evolution given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 It is interesting to juxtapose these two viewpoints.
 As a lattice model, one is typically only interested in lattices for which
 the energy and the probability density are invariant under the action of
 the translation operator.
 That is, one is interested only in the classical Hamiltonians of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Classical Hamiltonian"

\end_inset

 which are translation-invariant: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(\tau^{n}\sigma\right)=H\left(\sigma\right)\]

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considered as a dynamical system, one is typically interested in the time
 evolution of densities on the unit square, that is, of real-valued maps
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:[0,1]\times[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The time evolution of a density can be simply understood as a physical
 model, where the density is a local density of some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of points 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

, with the time evolution of each point given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the time evolution of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or density is given by the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{T}\rho\right](x,y)=\left(\rho\circ\tau^{-1}\right)(x,y)=\rho\left(2x-\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor \,,\,\frac{y+\left\lfloor 2x\right\rfloor }{2}\right)\]

\end_inset

The transfer operator is thus a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is the set of functions on the unit square.
 Clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator.
 Here, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is used to remind us that this is now the transfer operator on the two-sided
 lattice; it can be written as a combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{B}$
\end_inset

 and the Koopman operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}_{B}$
\end_inset

 for the single-sided lattice.
 One is interested in characterizing the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general idea behind equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Classical Hamiltonian"

\end_inset

 can be immediately appealed to, to construct some of the eigenstates of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, on considers functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
f=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}g\circ\tau^{n}\label{eq:Baker's eigenstates}\end{equation}

\end_inset

given some function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,y)$
\end_inset

 and number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Formally, such an 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

.
 In practical terms, it is evident that not all possible 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 can make the sum convergent, although one might expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 on the unit circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|=1$
\end_inset

 of the complex plane might lead to a convergent sum.
 Thus immediately, one deduces that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 must surely be a unitary operator.
 The unitarity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 makes intuitive sense in a certain way: the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is invertible, and one expects time-reversible evolution to be described
 by unitary operators.

Measure-theoretic description
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, it will be shown that the transfer operator is the push-forward
 of the shift operator; a theorem and a sequence of lemmas will be posed,
 that hold in general form.
 The point of this theorem is to disentangle the role of topology, and specifica
lly, the role of measure theory, from the use of the shift operator.
 We begin with a general setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a topological space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and a field 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 over the reals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 may be taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 itself, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or some more general field over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to being a field over the reals is is required, so that it can be used
 in conjunction with a measure; measures are always real-valued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may then define the algebra of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as the set of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:X\to F$
\end_inset

.
 An algebra is a vector space endowed with multiplication between vectors.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is a vector space, in that given two functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1},f_{2}\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

, their linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $af_{1}+bf_{2}$
\end_inset

 is also an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 may be interpreted to be the vectors of a vector space.
 Multiplication is the point-wise multiplication of function values; that
 is, the product 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $(f_{1}f_{2})(x)=f_{1}(x)\cdot f_{2}(x)$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}$
\end_inset

 is again an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

.
 Since one clearly has 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}f_{2}=f_{2}f_{1}$
\end_inset

, multiplication is commutative, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is also a commutative ring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 may be endowed with a topology.
 The coarsest topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
weak topology
\emph default
, which is obtained by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 to be the space that is topological dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 As a vector space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 may be endowed with a norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert f\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 For example, one may take the norm to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{p}$
\end_inset

-norm 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\Vert f\right\Vert _{p}=\left(\int\left|f(x)\right|^{p}dx\right)^{1/p}\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$
\end_inset

, this norm converts the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 into the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Other norms are possible, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 has the structure of a Banach space rather than a Hilbert space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now a homomorphism of topological spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

.
 This homomorphism induces the pullback 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}:\mathcal{F}(Y)\to\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 on the algebra of functions, by mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $f\mapsto g^{*}(f)=f\circ g$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\circ g:Y\to F$
\end_inset

.
 The pullback is a linear operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{*}(af_{1}+bf_{2})=ag^{*}(f_{1})+bg^{*}(f_{2})\]

\end_inset

That the pullback is linear is easily demonstrated by considering how 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}f$
\end_inset

 acts at a point: 
\begin_inset Formula $(g^{*}f)(x)=(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$
\end_inset

 and so the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{*}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $af_{1}+bf_{2}$
\end_inset

 follows trivially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may construct an analogous mapping, but going in the opposite direction,
 called the push-forward: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}:\mathcal{F}(X)\to\mathcal{F}(Y)$
\end_inset

.
 There are two ways of defining a push-forward.
 One way is to define it in terms of the sheaves of functions on subsets
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 The sheaf-theoretic description is more or less insensitive to the ideas
 of measurability, whereas this is important to the definition of the transfer
 operator, as witnessed by the appearance of the Jacobian determinant in
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

.
 By contrast, the measure-theoretic push-forward captures this desirable
 aspect.
 It may be defined as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One endows the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 with sigma-algebras 
\begin_inset Formula $(X,\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(Y,\mathcal{B})$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is the set of subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 obeying the axioms of a sigma-algebra, and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

 is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measurable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if, for all Borel sets 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

, one has the pre-image 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(B)\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 being a Borel set as well.
 Thus, a measurable mapping induces a push-forward on the sigma-algebras:
 that is, one has a push-forward 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}:\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})\to\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B})$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f\mapsto g_{*}(f)=f\circ g^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which is defined by virtue of the measurability of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The push-forward is a linear operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{*}(af_{1}+bf_{2})=ag_{*}(f_{1})+bg_{*}(f_{2})\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One regains the transfer operator as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

 by considering the limiting behavior of the push-forward on progressively
 smaller sets.
 That is, one has
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
The transfer operator is the point-set topology limit of the measure-theoretic
 push-forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The proof that follows is informal, so as to keep it simple.
 It is aimed mostly at articulating the language and terminology of measure
 theory.
 The result is none-the-less rigorous, if taken within the confines of the
 definitions presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Introduce a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{A}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

 and analogously 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 The mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is measure-preserving if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is a push-forward of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, that is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu=\mu\circ g^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The measure is used to rigorously define integration on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 can be informally understood to be integrals, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(A)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 may be understood as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(A)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)d\mu(z)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)\left|\mu^{\prime}(z)\right|dz\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mu^{\prime}(x)\right|$
\end_inset

 is to be understood as the Jacobean determinant at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 can be understood to be a function that is being integrated over the set
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, whose integral is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(A)$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by means of a limit.
 One considers a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, each successively smaller than the last, each containing the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 One then has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\overrightarrow{A\ni x}}\,\frac{f(A)}{\mu(A)}=\tilde{f}(x)\]

\end_inset

which can be intuitively proved by considering 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 so small that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}$
\end_inset

 is approximately constant over 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(A)=\int_{A}\tilde{f}(z)d\mu(z)\approx\tilde{f}(x)\int_{A}d\mu=\tilde{f}(x)\mu(A)\]

\end_inset

To perform the analogous limit for the push-forward, one must consider a
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in Y$
\end_inset

 and sets 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 containing 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 In what follows, it is now assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to Y$
\end_inset

 is a multi-sheeted countable covering of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 By this it is meant that for any 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 that is not a branch-point, there is a nice neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 such that its pre-image consists of the union of an at most countable number
 of pair-wise disjoint sets.
 That is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 not a branch point, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $B\ni y$
\end_inset

 sufficiently small, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{-1}(B)=A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is either finite or stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

, and where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\ne j$
\end_inset

.
 At branch points, such a decomposition may not be possible.
 The axiom of sigma-additivity guarantees that such multi-sheeted covers
 behave just the way one expects integrals to behave: in other words, one
 has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mu\left(g^{-1}(B)\right)=\mu\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mu\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

whenever the collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

 are pair-wise disjoint.
 Similarly, in order to have the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 behave as one expects integrals to behave, one must restrict 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$
\end_inset

 to contain only sigma-additive functions as well, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(g^{-1}(B)\right)=f\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}f\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

As the set 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is taken to be smaller and smaller, the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

 will become smaller as well.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 the corresponding limit point of each 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x_{j})=y$
\end_inset

 and the pre-image of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 consists of these points: 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(y)=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\cdots\left|\, g(x_{j})=y\right.\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 One now combines these provisions to write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left[g_{*}\tilde{f}\right](y) & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{B\ni y}}\,\left[\frac{\left(g_{*}f\right)(B)}{\nu(B)}\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{B\ni y}}\,\left[\frac{\left(f\circ g^{-1}\right)(B)}{\nu(B)}\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni g^{-1}(y)}}\,\frac{f\left(A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots\right)}{\nu(B)}\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni g^{-1}(y)}}\,\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k}f\left(A_{j}\right)}{\nu(B)}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{j=1}^{k}\tilde{f}\left(x_{j}\right)\lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}}\,\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{\nu(B)}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The limit in the last line of this sequence of manipulations may be interpreted
 in two ways, depending on whether one wants to define the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to be the push-forward of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, or not.
 If one does take it to be the push-forward, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, then one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}}\,\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{g_{*}\mu(B)}=\frac{1}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This last is a standard result of measure theory, and can be intuitively
 proved by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(A_{j}\right)=B$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nu\left(B\right)=\int_{A_{j}}g^{\prime}(z)\, d\mu(z)\approx g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\mu\left(A_{j}\right)\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Assembling this with the previous result, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left[g_{*}\tilde{f}\right](y)=\sum_{x_{j}\in g^{-1}(y)}\frac{\tilde{f}\left(x_{j}\right)}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}\label{eq:Transfer-point}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which may be easily recognized as equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: transfer-jacobi"

\end_inset

.
 This concludes the proof of the theorem, that the transfer operator is
 just the point-set topology limit of the push-forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In simplistic terms, the push-forward can be thought of as a kind of change-of-v
ariable.
 Thus, one should not be surprised by the following lemma, which should
 be recognizable as the Jacobian, from basic calculus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
(Jacobian) One has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{x_{j}\in g^{-1}(y)}\frac{1}{\left|g^{\prime}\left(x_{j}\right)\right|}=1\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This follows by taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{A_{j}\ni x_{j}}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{g_{*}\mu(B)}=\frac{\mu\left(A_{j}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}\mu\left(A_{i}\right)}\]

\end_inset

 and then summing over 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "cor:unit-eigenvec"

\end_inset

The uniform distribution (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the measure) is an eigenvector of the transfer operator, associated with
 the eigenvalue one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This may be proved in two ways.
 From the viewpoint of point-sets, one simply takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{f}=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Transfer-point"

\end_inset

, and applies the lemma above.
 From the viewpoint of the sigma-algebra, this is nothing more than a rephrasing
 of the starting point, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, and then taking the space 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X$
\end_inset

, so that the push-forward induced by 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

 is a measure-preserving map: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last corollary is more enlightening when it is turned on its side; it
 implies two well-known theorems, which follow easily in this framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
(Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius theorem).
 All transfer operators are continuous, compact, bounded operators; furthermore,
 they are isometries of Banach spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This theorem is of course just the Frobenius-Perron theorem, recast in the
 context of measure theory.
 By definition, the measures have unit norm: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \mu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \nu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is nothing more than the statement that the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are measurable: the total volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is, by definition, one.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=g_{*}\mu$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\mu\right\Vert _{1}=1$
\end_inset

, and this holds for all possible measures 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Recall the definition of a bounded operator.
 Given a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:U\to V$
\end_inset

 between Banach spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is bounded if there exists a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C<\infty$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}\le C\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}$
\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in U$
\end_inset

.
 But this is exactly the case above, with 
\begin_inset Formula $T=g_{*}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\mathcal{F}(Y)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C=1$
\end_inset

.
 The norm of a bounded operator is conventionally defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\Vert T\right\Vert =\sup_{u\ne0}\frac{\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}}{\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}}=\sup_{\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{U}\le1}\left\Vert Tu\right\Vert _{V}\]

\end_inset

and so we have the norm of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 being 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\right\Vert =1$
\end_inset

.
 That 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is an isometry follows trivially from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\mu\right\Vert _{1}=\left\Vert \nu\right\Vert _{1}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is linear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:unit-eigenvec"

\end_inset

 can also be treated as a corollary to the Perron-Frobenius theorem: namely,
 that there is at least one vector that corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 This eigenvector is in fact the Haar measure, as the next theorem shows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "thm:Haar-measure"

\end_inset

(Haar measure) For any homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $g:X\to X$
\end_inset

, one may find a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

; that is, every homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 induces a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is a measure-preserving map.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, then the measure is unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The fixed point exists because 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

is a bounded operator, and the space of measures is compact, and so a bounded
 operator on a compact space will have a fixed point.
 The existence of the fixed point is given by the Markov-Kakutani theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p 456"
key "Dunford1957"

\end_inset

.
 The Markov-Kakutani theorem also provides the uniqueness condition: if
 there are other push-forwards 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{*}$
\end_inset

 that commute with 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

, then each such push-forward will also have a fixed point.
 The goal is then to show that when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, there are no other functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 that commute with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 But this follows from the definition of ergodicity: when 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is ergodic, there are no invariant subspaces, and the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is the whole space.
 As there are no invariant subspaces, there are no operators that can map
 between these subspaces, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 there are no other commuting operators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A peculiar special case is worth mentioning: if 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is not ergodic on the whole space, then typically one has that the orbit
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 splits or foliates the measure space into a bunch of pairwise disjoint
 leaves, with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 being ergodic on each leaf.
 The Markov-Kakutani theorem then implies that there is a distinct fixed
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 in each leaf, and that there is a mapping that takes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 in one leaf to that in another.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the language of dynamical systems, the push-forward 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is commonly written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}$
\end_inset

, so that one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{*}=\mathcal{L}_{g}\,:\,\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\to\mathcal{F}\left(X\right)\]

\end_inset

now being called the transfer operator or the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the language of physics, the fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ground state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a system.
 When it is unique, then the ground state is not degenerate; when it is
 not unique, then the ground state is said to be degenerate.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{*}$
\end_inset

 is the time-evolution operator of the system; it shows how physical fields
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in\mathcal{F}(X)$
\end_inset

 over a space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 evolve over time.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert g_{*}\right\Vert =1$
\end_inset

 is essentially a way of stating that time-evolution is unitary; the Frobenius-P
erron operator is the unitary time-evolution operator of the system.
 What is called

second quantization
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in physics should be interpreted as the fitting of the space

 in terms of that basis.

\begin_layout Section
The Topological Zeta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX ToDo: explain topo zeta gets this has this name, and why this concept
 is important.
 XXX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The topological zeta of the Bernoulli operator can be computed very easily
 in the polynomial basis because we know the eigenvalues and these form
 a simple series.
 We'll define the Bernoulli topological zeta as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{B}(t)\equiv\frac{1}{\det\left[\mathbb{I}-t\mathcal{L}_{B}\right]}\]

\end_inset

We start by noting its inverse: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\det\left[\mathbb{I}-t\mathcal{L}_{B}\right] & = & \prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-t\;2^{-n}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & 1-t\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}2^{-j}+t^{2}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}2^{-j}\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
k=0\\
k\neq j\end{array}}^{\infty}2^{-k}-t^{3}...\nonumber \\
 & = & 1-2t+\frac{8}{3}t^{2}-\frac{16}{7}t^{3}+\frac{128}{105}t^{4}-...\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Successive terms of this series are hard to compute, and it would be interesting
 to know what the generating function for this series is.
 The series appears to have a circle of convergence of radius one.
 The zeta can be computed directly by working with its logarithm: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\log\zeta_{B}(t) & = & \log\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(1-t\;2^{-n}\right)^{-1}\nonumber \\
 & = & -\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\log\left(1-t\;2^{-n}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k}\;\frac{2^{k}}{2^{k}-1}\nonumber \\
 & = & -\log(1-t)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k}\;\frac{1}{2^{k}-1}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}\mathcal{L}_{B}^{k}=2^{k}/(2^{k}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Of some curiosity is the proximity of the Erdos-Borwein constant: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
1.6066... & = & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n}-1}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{d(n)}{2^{n}}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

 which marks the first appearance of a classical number-theoretic function
 in the proceedings so far: 
\begin_inset Formula $d(n)$
\end_inset

 is the number of divisors of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 This arises from the Lambert series
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}d(n)x^{n}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{1-x^{n}}\]

\end_inset

The sum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{1-2^{-k}}\]

\end_inset

can be re-summed as a Lambert series, namely, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_{k}2^{-k}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{k}=\sum_{n|k}(2t)^{n}\]

\end_inset

The analytic/meromorphic structure of this zeta is not clear; its dull within
 the unit disk, and its not quite obvious what the continuation is outside
 of the disk.
 XXX ToDo: get the full analytic structure.

Review of Dirac Notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix reviews the Dirac or bra-ket notation on the polynomial and
 square-integrable spaces, and illustrates this by performing a calculation
 that mixes the two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Polynomial-Representation"

\end_inset

, we constructed the polynomial space, and its dual.
 In Dirac notation, the basis vectors are the monomials: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle x|n\right\rangle =x^{n}\]

\end_inset

 while the dual vectors are the linear functionals 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle n|x\right\rangle =\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\delta^{(n)}(x)\]

\end_inset

That these are truly dual is expressed by equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:orthogonality"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:analytic completeness"

\end_inset

; namely, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|m\right\rangle =\delta_{mn}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}_{A}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left|n\right\rangle \left\langle n\right|$
\end_inset

.
 The later may be understood as the identity operator on the space of polynomial
s, or, more broadly, on the space of analytic functions.
 This interpretation is justified by realizing that it is just a formalized
 notation for the Taylor's series in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Taylors bra-kets"

\end_inset

.
 The monomials, and their duals, truly provide a basis for the space of
 analytic functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now review the analogous situation, this time for the Hilbert space
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 of square-integrable functions.
 The review is remedial but is needed to present the surprising results.
 One writes, for some (periodic) function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

, the Fourier Series as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos2\pi nx\;+b_{n}\sin2\pi nx\]

\end_inset

where the conjugates of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a_{n}=2\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\,\cos(2\pi nx)\, dx\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{n}=2\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\,\sin(2\pi nx)\, dx\]

\end_inset

The sine and cosine notation is somewhat awkward, and it will be easier
 to use the complex exponential 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(i2\pi mx\right)=\cos\left(i2\pi mx\right)+i\sin\left(i2\pi mx\right)$
\end_inset

.
 At the same time, let us move over to bra-ket notation.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|em\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 will denote the basis vectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 These may be defined in terms of their components in coordinate space,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x|em\right\rangle =\exp(i2\pi mx)$
\end_inset

.
 The conjugate vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle en\right|$
\end_inset

 have an equally simple representation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle en|x\right\rangle =\exp(-i2\pi nx)$
\end_inset

.
 These are orthogonal over coordinate space in the usual sense: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle em|en\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}dx\,\left\langle em|x\right\rangle \left\langle x|en\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}dx\,\exp(2\pi i(n-m)x)=\delta_{nm}\]

\end_inset

These are also complete over coordinate space, in that, for any arbitrary
 square-integrable coordinate-space function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\left\langle x|f\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 , one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
f\left(x\right)= & \int_{0}^{1}dy\,\delta(x-y)\, f(y)\\
= & \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(i2\pi nx)\int_{0}^{1}dy\,\exp(-i2\pi ny)f(y)\\
= & \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(i2\pi nx)\int_{0}^{1}dy\,\left\langle en|y\right\rangle \left\langle y|f\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left\langle x|en\right\rangle \left\langle en|f\right\rangle \\
= & \left\langle x\right|\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|en\right\rangle \left\langle en\right|\left|f\right\rangle \\
= & \left\langle x\right|1_{F}\left|f\right\rangle \\
= & \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \end{align*}

\end_inset

The above made use of the usual expansion of the Dirac delta as a Fourier
 series:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\left(x-y\right)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(i2\pi n\left(x-y\right)\right)\]

\end_inset

The completeness of the basis over 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 may be expressed as a decomposition of the identity operator on 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{F}=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|em\right\rangle \left\langle em\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 reminds us of the Fourier-series nature of this identity operator.
 The identity operator has the matrix elements that one expects in both
 the Fourier space and in coordinate space: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle em\right|1_{F}\left|en\right\rangle =\delta_{nm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x\right|1_{F}\left|y\right\rangle =\delta(x-y)$
\end_inset

 .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, all of the above definitions and developments are standard textbook
 fare.
 We now embark on a slightly more challenging calculation: to show that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m\right|1_{F}\left|n\right\rangle =\delta_{nm}$
\end_inset

.
 In the process, one encounters some divergent sums; these can, however,
 be rescued by means of analytic continuation.

\left\langle n|em\right\rangle = & \int_{0}^{1}dx\left\langle n|x\right\rangle \left\langle x|em\right\rangle \\
= & \int_{0}^{1}dx\,\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\delta^{(n)}(x)\, e^{i2\pi mx}\\

\end_inset

while 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n|e0\right\rangle =\delta_{n0}$
\end_inset

.
 Essentially, this is nothing more than a plain-old Taylor's series expansion
 of the exponential function; reasonable, insofar as the exponential function
 is an entire function on the complex plane.
 The first step in the above was to insert the coordinate-space identity
 operator:
\begin_inset Formula \[
1_{C}=\int_{0}^{1}dx\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|\]

\end_inset

That 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{C}$
\end_inset

 deserves the status of an identity operator may be seen by noting that,
 for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(y\right)=\left\langle y|f\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}dx\left\langle y|x\right\rangle \left\langle x|f\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}dx\delta\left(y-x\right)f\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

, where we made use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle y|x\right\rangle =\delta\left(y-x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conjugate vectors have a slightly trickier form.
 They are the Fourier components of monomials.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $m\neq0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ne0$
\end_inset

 one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left\langle em|n\right\rangle = & \int_{0}^{1}dy\left\langle em|y\right\rangle \left\langle y|n\right\rangle \\
= & \int_{0}^{1}\exp(-2\pi imy)\, y^{n}\, dy\\
= & \frac{-1}{2\pi im}+\frac{n}{2\pi im}\int_{0}^{1}\exp(-2\pi imy)\, y^{n-1}\, dy\\
= & -\frac{1}{2\pi im}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\left(\frac{1}{2\pi im}\right)^{k}\end{align*}

\end_inset

while, for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

, one simply has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle e0|n\right\rangle =1/(n+1)$
\end_inset

, and, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle em|0\right\rangle =\delta_{m0}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now try to explicitly evaluate the matrix elements of the Fourier
 identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{F}$
\end_inset

 in the polynomial representation.
 That is, we attempt to write the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{F}=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|em\right\rangle \left\langle em\right|$
\end_inset

.
 So, by direct substitution,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left\langle p\right|1_{F}\left|n\right\rangle = & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\left\langle p|em\right\rangle \left\langle em|n\right\rangle \\
= & \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\delta_{p0}+\left(1-\delta_{p0}\right)\frac{\left(2\pi im\right)^{p}}{p!}\right]\left[\frac{\delta_{m0}}{n+1}-\frac{\left(1-\delta_{m0}\right)}{2\pi im}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\left(\frac{1}{2\pi im}\right)^{k}\right]\end{align*}

\end_inset

Consider first the matrix element 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\ne0$
\end_inset

, to see the misery of this expression: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle p\ne0\right|1_{F}\left|n=1\right\rangle =-\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{p-1}}{p!}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\left[m^{p-1}-\left(-m\right)^{p-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 even, the sum on the right vanishes.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 even, the sum on the right is formally divergent.
 One may rescue the situation by making the Ansatz that the summation should
 have been replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(1-p)$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 that the summation should be replaced by it's analytic continuation, which
 is the Riemann zeta function.
 So:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle p\ne0\right|1_{F}\left|n=1\right\rangle =-\frac{2\left(2\pi i\right)^{p-1}}{p!}\zeta\left(1-p\right)\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1,$
\end_inset

we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(0\right)=-1/2$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p=1\right|1_{F}\left|n=1\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

 as expected.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 odd, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(-2k\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for all positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

, and so one has exactly what was expected: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p\ne0\right|1_{F}\left|n=1\right\rangle =\delta_{p1}$
\end_inset

.
 Calculations for other values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are somewhat more difficult, but ultimately provide the expected answer:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p\right|1_{F}\left|n\right\rangle =\left\langle p|n\right\rangle =\delta_{pn}$
\end_inset

.
 There is, however, a cautionary tale that becomes clear as one tries to
 carry out this calculation: the manipulations can become painful, and formally
 divergent sums are best avoided before-hand, by re-arranging terms before
 they become a problem.

\begin_layout Section
The Koopman Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Koopman operator is in a certain sense conjugate to the Frobenius-Perron
 operator, and defines how observables evolve.
 Given a density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 we say that the observation of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle f\,\right\rangle _{\rho}=\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\rho(x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

observable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from usage in quantum mechanics, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is associated with the eigenvalues of an operator.
 We do not need to appeal to these operator equations for the following
 development.
 The Koopman operator 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 gives the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, thus: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
K_{g}:\left\langle f\,\right\rangle _{\rho}\rightarrow\left\langle K_{g}f\,\right\rangle _{\rho}=\int_{0}^{1}[K_{g}f](x)\rho(x)\, dx=\int_{0}^{1}f(x)[U_{g}\rho](x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

In Dirac bra-ket notation, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1}f(x)[U_{g}\rho](x)\, dx= & \int_{0}^{1}\left\langle x|U_{g}|\rho\right\rangle \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \, dx\\
= & \int_{0}^{1}dx\int_{0}^{1}dy\left\langle x|U_{g}|y\right\rangle \left\langle y|\rho\right\rangle \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \, dx\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[K_{g}f\right](y)=\int_{0}^{1}\left\langle x|U_{g}|y\right\rangle \left\langle x|f\right\rangle \, dx=\int_{0}^{1}U_{g}(x,y)f(x)\, dx=\int_{0}^{1}\delta\left(x-g(y)\right)f(x)\, dx\]

\end_inset

This gives the action of the Koopman operator in a coordinate-space representati
on.
 As is the recurring theme, different representations can lead to different
 results.
 In the coordinate-space representation, the Koopman operator appears to
 be the transpose of the Frobenius-Perron operator, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x,y)=U(y,x)$
\end_inset

.
 However, in a general representation, whether the Koopman operator is the
 transpose or the complex conjugate or something else needs to be determined
 on a case-by-case basis, with an appeal to the particular operator 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 and the representations on which it works.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Topologically Conjugate Maps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conjugation of the function that generates the map will provide, in general,
 another map that behaves exactly the same as the first, as long as the
 conjugating function is a 1-1 and onto diffeomorphism.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is invertible, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=\phi\circ g\circ\phi^{-1}\]

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 will iterate the same way that 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 does: 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{n}=\phi\circ g^{n}\circ\phi^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The orbit of any point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 under the map 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is completely isomorphic to the orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 under the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Because the (chaotic) point dynamics of these two maps are isomorphic,
 we expect just about any related construction and analysis to show evidence
 of this isomorphism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, we expect that the Koopman and Frobenius-Perron operators
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 are conjugate to those for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{\gamma}=U_{\phi}^{-1}U_{g}U_{\phi}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX ToDo derive the above.
 Show that eigenvalues are preserved.
 XXX A good derivation is given in the GKW paper.
 The most trivial way to see that the eigenvalues are unchanged is through
 the formal definition of the characteristic polynomial for this operator,
 which is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{U}(\lambda)=\det\left[U_{g}-\lambda\mathbb{I}\right]\]

\end_inset

Just as in the finite-dimensional case, a similarity transform commutes
 inside the determinant, leaving the characteristic polynomial unchanged.
 XXX ToDo a more correct, non-formal proof that the eigenvalues are preserved.
 Note, as the GKW paper notes, that although one can still have similarity
 xforms when fun is not diffeomorphic, that, in such a case, the eigenvalues
 are not preserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the construction of this proof, we invoke the Jacobian 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|d\phi(y)/dy\right|_{y=\phi^{-1}(x)}$
\end_inset

 and thus, in order to preserve the polynomial-rep eigenvalues, the conjugating
 function must be a diffeomorphism; a homeomorphism does not suffice.
 One can have conjugate maps with completely isomorphic point dynamics,
 but the eigenvalue spectra associated with these maps will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be identical.
 Am explicit example is the GKW operator, which is isomorphic to the dyadic
 sawtooth operator, but is not diffeomorphic.
 The two operators have distinct spectra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Topological Zeta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting quantity is the topological zeta function associated
 with the transfer operator.
 It is formally defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{U_{g}}(t)=\frac{1}{\det\left[\mathbb{I}-tU_{g}\right]}\]

\end_inset

and embeds number-theoretic information about the map.
 Using standard formal manipulations on operators, one can re-write the
 above as the operator equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta_{U_{g}}(t)=\exp\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{t^{k}}{k}\;\textrm{Tr}U_{g}^{k}\]

\end_inset

Of associated interest is the Maclaurin Series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
t\frac{d}{dt}\log\zeta_{U_{g}}(t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}n_{k}t^{k}\]

\end_inset

where we can read off 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{k}=\textrm{Tr}U_{g}^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 From graph theory and the theory of dynamical systems, it is known that
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{k}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the number of periodic orbits of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In the context of dynamical systems, this zeta is often referred to as
 the Artin-Mazur Zeta function.
 In the context of graph theory, it is referred to as the Ihara Zeta.
 Both are connected to the Selberg Zeta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard definition of the Ihara Zeta applies only to the adjacency
 matrix of finite-sized graphs.
 Adjacency matrices only have (non-negative) integer entries as matrix elements.
 Thus, we ask: given an appropriate basis, can an infinite-dimensional transfer
 operator be written so as to have integer entries as matrix elements?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard definition of the Artin-Mazur Zeta function requires that the
 number of fixed points (periodic orbits) be a finite number.
 For the operators that we are studying, there will in general be (countably)
 infinite number of periodic orbits.
 Yet the zeta will still be well defined, although the coefficients of the
 Maclaurin expansion will not be integers.
 Can these be reinterpreted as a density or measure?

\begin_layout Standard
One may confirm this by following a very old-fashioned recipe for obtaining
 the functional relation for a zeta-like sum.
 Start by expressing the gamma function as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\, e^{-2\pi ny}y^{s-1}=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi n)^{s}}\]

\end_inset

Substituting into the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and performing the sum, one may write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta(x;s)=2s\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\,\frac{y^{s-1}}{\exp\left(-2\pi i(x+iy)\right)-1}\]

\end_inset

Then, following a traditional trick 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "pp 13 ff"
key "Edw74"

\end_inset

, re-write this as a contour integral 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta(x;s)=\frac{-is}{\sin\pi s}\oint\frac{(-y)^{s}}{\exp\left(-2\pi i(x+iy)\right)-1}\;\frac{dy}{y}\]

\end_inset

where the contour is taken to extend from 
\begin_inset Formula $+\infty+i\epsilon$
\end_inset

, running just above the positive real axis, to the origin, circling the
 origin in a clockwise fashion, and returning to 
\begin_inset Formula $+\infty-i\epsilon$
\end_inset

 just under the real axis.
 The contour essentially encloses the cut of the logarithm in the expression
 
\begin_inset Formula $(-y)^{s}=\exp s\,\log(-y)$
\end_inset

.
 The old fashioned recipe calls for closing the contour at infinity (in
 a counter-clockwise direction) and then taking the dubious step of asserting
 Cauchy's Theorem to equate the integral around the cut to the sum of the
 poles, where we note that we have a pole whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $x+iy=n$
\end_inset

 for some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 By doing this we get the formal summation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{i\sin\pi s}{s}\beta(x;s)=\exp\left(\frac{i\pi s}{2}\right)\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}(n-x)^{s-1}\]

\end_inset

This is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal sum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, since the preceding steps required taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

 whereas now one needs to take 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s<0$
\end_inset

.
 This is a bit of jiggery-pokery that is common for this type of presentation;
 a different set of tools is required to do better.
 So we proceed, ignoring these difficulties.
 Re-write this sum as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{i\sin\pi s}{s}\beta(x;s)=\exp\left(\frac{i\pi s}{2}\right)\left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+(1-x))^{s-1}+e^{-i\pi(s-1)}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+x)^{s-1}\right]\]

\end_inset

where we were mindful to rotate counter-clockwise for 
\begin_inset Formula $n<0$
\end_inset

 when replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $(-)^{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-i\pi n}$
\end_inset

 instead of the sloppy and incorrect 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\pi n}$
\end_inset

.
 Recognizing the sums as the Hurwitz Zeta, this then gives the desired result:
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\beta(x;s)=\frac{is}{\sin\pi s}\left[e^{-i\pi s/2}\zeta(1-s,x)-e^{i\pi s/2}\zeta(1-s,1-x)\right]\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to invert this and solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

; one gets 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(1-s,x)=\frac{1}{2s}\left[e^{-i\pi s/2}\beta(x;s)+e^{i\pi s/2}\beta(1-x;s)\right]\]

\end_inset

thus proving the assertion that the Hurwitz zeta is an eigenfunction of
 the Bernoulli operator, with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{s-1}$
\end_inset

.
 To verify the correctness of the above steps, expand the exponentials in
 terms of their real and imaginary parts, to find that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta(z,x)=\frac{2\Gamma(1-z)}{\left(2\pi\right)^{1-z}}\left[\sin\left(\frac{\pi z}{2}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2\pi nx)}{n^{1-z}}+\cos\left(\frac{\pi z}{2}\right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi nx)}{n^{1-z}}\right]\]

\end_inset

which agrees with standard textbook presentations of the Hurwitz zeta; see

 of

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(1+s)$
\end_inset

 gets very small as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 gets large, and so the normalization brings them to visually comparable
 ranges.
 Although these curves clearly look very lumpy, they are

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in(0,1]$
\end_inset

 but not at the endpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$

 At the endpoint, the derivative becomes divergent after just a few derivatives,
 where the curves are behaving essentially as 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{s-1}$
\end_inset

.
 This pending divergence and the true nature of the lumpiness is made clear
 in the next graphic.
 Although these curves appear to be sine-wave-like, it is perhaps more correct
 to think of them as being Bernoulli-polynomial-like.
 That is, the general case will look similar to the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\left\lfloor \Re s\right\rfloor }(x)$

.
 Of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}(x)$

 for

\begin_inset Formula $x=0,1$
\end_inset

.
 That is, for for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>0$
\end_inset

, the Hurwitz zeta 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s,x)$
\end_inset

 has a clear singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{-s}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 Separating this out explicitly, one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\sin\pi s}{is}\beta(x;s)= & \frac{e^{-i\pi s/2}}{x^{1-s}}-\frac{e^{i\pi s/2}}{(1-x)^{1-s}}+\\
 & e^{-i\pi s/2}\left(\zeta(1-s,1+x)\right)-e^{i\pi s/2}\left(\zeta(1-s,2-x)\right)\end{align*}

\end_inset

The first part of the equation above encapsulates the singularities at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,1$
\end_inset

 that occur when working with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|=\left|2^{-s}\right|>1$
\end_inset

, that is, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s<0$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining term is well-behaved and is shown in figure

This figure shows 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\eta_{even}(x;\sigma)=\frac{\cos\pi\sigma/2}{\sigma}\left[\beta(x;\sigma)+\beta(1-x;\sigma)\right]-x^{\sigma-1}-(1-x)^{\sigma-1}\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\eta_{odd}(x;\sigma)=\frac{\sin\pi\sigma/2}{\sigma}\left[\beta(x;\sigma)-\beta(1-x;\sigma)\right]-x^{\sigma-1}+(1-x)^{\sigma-1}\]

\end_inset

for a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-3.3$
\end_inset

, corresponding to an eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $9.85=2^{3.3}$
\end_inset

.
 Except for the singularity, we see that the finite part of these eigenfunctions
 is very well behaved.

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|=\left|2^{-s}\right|<1/2$
\end_inset

, that is, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

, there is no singularity, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 is finite on the entire interval 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, including the endpoints.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<\Re s\leq1$
\end_inset

 there is a bit of funny-business at the endpoints; that is, there is a
 weak divergence there, but the function overall remains square-integrable.
 Things break loose after that, with the exception of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

, where we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;0)=-1$
\end_inset

, a constant independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This essentially follows from the nature of differentiation on the Bernoulli
 polynomials, which we'll see below.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 near zero, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(x;s)$
\end_inset

 has severe ringing artifacts in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, suffering from a variation of the Gibbs phenomenon.

This figure shows ringing/Gibbs phenomenon as 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 approaches zero.
 In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

, we expect the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 to approach the trivial eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{s\rightarrow0^{+}}\Re\beta(x;s)=-B_{0}(x)=-1$
\end_inset

.
 As this graph shows, the function is indeed trying very desperately to
 get flat, with not much success.
 The ringing occurs only at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

; there is no problem with convergence near larger integers, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{s\rightarrow n}\Re(-i)^{s}\beta(x;s)=-B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

 converges very smoothly and cleanly.

The function

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in(0,1)$
\end_inset

 but not at the endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0,1$
\end_inset

.
 This can be easily seen by writing the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{dx}\beta(x;s)=2\pi i\beta(x;s-1)\]

\end_inset

and so even if one starts with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s>1$
\end_inset

, each derivative moves one step closer to the danger zone.

\begin_layout Itemize
While this paper focuses primarily on the polynomial and square-integrable
 eigenfunctions of the Bernoulli operator, there is also a class of non-differen
tiable, non-integrable eigenfunctions that can be precisely defined in terms
 of the shift operator on a one-dimensional lattice model, the Ising model
 of statistical mechanics.
 The Ising model has a natural topology that is distinctly different from
 the topology of the real number line; this alternate topology allows for
 a much, much larger set of eigenfunctions.
 This is discussed in greater detail in
