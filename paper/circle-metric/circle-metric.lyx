\begin_layout Abstract
Kolomogorov's(?) circle map 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n+1}=x_{n}+\omega-K\sin2\pi x_{n}$
\end_inset

 famously exhibits both stable mode-locking behavior and chaotic motion.
 In the mode-locked regions, that is, when two different frequencies and
 couplings 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 are close enough to one-another, then the two different sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 are generally close to one-another as well.
 This no longer holds when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 are on opposite sides of a mode-locking boundary.
 This paper explores some of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{p}$
\end_inset

 metrics on the sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}-y_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 generated by the circle map.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circle map 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n+1}=x_{n}+\omega-K\sin2\pi x_{n}$
\end_inset

 is a simplified model for weakly coupled oscillators and is broadly studied
 as a dynamical system having both periodic and chaotic behavior.
 It is intersting both mathematically, and from a physics and engineering
 point of view: it is a model of both electronic phase-locked loops, and
 for celestial mechanics, where tide-locking can force planetary bodies
 and moons to orbit in synchrony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prominent feature of the circle map is that, for many regions of the parameter
 space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 the map exhibits 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mode locking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behavior.
 That is, the iterated sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 rapidly settles down to a periodic orbit that is very stable against small
 perturbations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The mode-locked regions are called

Arnold tongues

 these are explicitly visible in the image below.
 Each such tongue has a vee shape, with the sharp tip located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega_{0},K=0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In the mode-locked regions, the period of the orbit is given by the numerator
 of the Farey fraction that is nearest to the vee-tip frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

The image above shows the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le K\le1/2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Dark regions are mode-locked; the red area corresponds to chaotic orbits.
 The left and right black triangles correspond to fixed points, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}=c$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c.$
\end_inset

 These are orbits of period one.
 The central dark triangle corresponds to orbits of period two, where iteration
 bounces the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 between two values.
 The next largest tongues to the left and right of the center correspond
 to period 3.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 for these two are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2/3$
\end_inset

.
 After that, a tongue of period 4, anchored at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1/4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3/4$
\end_inset

; then after than, period 5 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1/5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4/5$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 The largest tongue in between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1/3$
\end_inset

 tongues is the one anchored at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=2/5$
\end_inset

; it is of period 5.
 The subdivision here follows Farey addition on the Stern-Brocot tree: two
 neighboring fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r/s$
\end_inset

 add together as 
\begin_inset Formula $(p+q)/(r+s)$
\end_inset

.
 The complete binary tree is generated by starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q=0/1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image is fractally self-similar, and there is a tongue anchored at every
 rational value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This gives a hint of the first mathematical curiosity: the rationals are
 a set of measure zero.
 Yet, for 
\begin_inset Formula $K>0$
\end_inset

, the rationals are mapped to a set that obviously has a measure greater
 than zero.
 How does this work? What about the regions 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in between
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 is irrational? These are hard to talk about, since the rationals are dense:
 in between any two irrationals is another rational.
 The irrationals map to the Cantor Set, built by the middle-third costruction.
 Each successive tongue splits an interval into two; the left and right
 halves organize into an infinite binary tree.
 It's worth calling this tree the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cantor tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, its always associated with the Cantor set.
 In the study of fractals and chaotic dynamical systems, both the Farey
 addition and the Cantor tree are pervasive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circle map corresponds to a simple model of weakly coupled rotators,
 mechanical or electrical.
 This is depicted in the diagram below.
 One is to imagine a strong motor, capable of driving with a fixed frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The motor is directly attached to a disk (labelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

driven
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the image below), so that it spins with the motor.
 On the circumfrence of this disk is a weak spring, the other end of which
 is attached to the circumfrence of a second disk, which is free to rotate
 in any way.
 The second disk is placed so that it is in the same plane as the first
 disk (so that the spring is only ever stretched, it is never torqued or
 twisted.) The second disk experiences no friction, and is free to spin,
 in any direction, at any speed.
 It is not hard to imagine that, for a stiff spring, that the second disk
 will be forced to spin synchronouly with the first.
 One can also imagine that, for a weak spring, and the second disk having
 some weight (some moment of inertia), the driving motor will bounce around
 the free-spinning disk in some random, chaotic way.

The figure above shows angular displacements 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 on the driven and free disks.
 Consider snapshots of the system, taken under a strobe light, flashing
 with interval 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 The driven disk will have an angular position 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\omega nT$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n'th$
\end_inset

 flash; the 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the angular velocity.
 The freely-rotating disk will just have an angular position 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 If we are careful to count how many times it has spun around, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be any real number.
 The circle map just models this situation as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n+1}=q_{n}+\omega-K\sin2\pi q_{n}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 some number that captures the combination of teh spring constant and the
 moment of inertia of the free disk.
 There are electrical models of this system as well.
 The weak coupling can be thought of as an antenna, picking up a signal
 from a distant but fixed station broadcasting a pure carrier with frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sketch above has already provided plenty of reasons why this system
 might be interesting to examine, and there is a variety of literature that
 looks into it, usually from the standpoint of a measure-peserving chaotic
 dynamical system.
 I won't provide a literature review here, other than to say all of the
 usual phenomena associated with iterated chaotic systems appears here as
 well.
 The goal of this text is not to repeat old news, but to focus on new things.
 Yet, some repetition of the well-known is unavoidable.

 The Moore plane was originally constructed as a counter-example in general
 topology: it is a particular kind of completely regular Hausdorff space
 that is not normal and not metrizable.

 A space is normal, if every two closed sets are separated by open neighborhoods
 (and thus, the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

literal "false"

\end_inset

 applies; the Tietze extension theorem works only for normal spaces, but
 not for regular spaces.)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The basis for this inspiration is worth reviewing here, and, for that,
 the defintion of the Moore plane must be breifly sketched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Moore plane consists of the closed upper-half subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=\left\{ \left(x,y\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\vert y\ge0\right\} $
\end_inset

 of the Euclidean plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The topology on it is peculiar: it is a combination of the standard topology,
 for points deep inside the plane, and a discrete topology for points near
 the real axis.
 It is defined as follows.
 First, define an open disk of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p,q\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 as usual:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{\epsilon}\left(p,q\right)=\left\{ \left(x,y\right)\vert\left(x-p\right)^{2}+\left(y-q\right)^{2}<\epsilon^{2},\epsilon>0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

The local basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}\left(p,q\right)$
\end_inset

 for the topology of the Moore plane is given by the sets
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{B}\left(p,q\right)=\begin{cases}
U_{\epsilon}\left(p,q\right) & \mbox{if }q>0\\
V_{\epsilon}\left(p\right)=U_{\epsilon}\left(p,\epsilon\right) & \mbox{if }q=0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

That is, at the real axis, each open disk is supplemented by a single point
 on the real number line.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

supplementation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gives the real axis the discrete topology: it consists only of the points
 in the real number line; there are no open subsets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hopefully, the reason why the Moore space can serve as an inspiration is
 clear, without any need for hand-waving or further explanation.
 Something weird happens at the real axis.
 A cursory examination of the cirlce map shows there is much more: something
 different happens for the rationals and the irrationals.
 The circle map is much, much crazier.
 But how can we make contact with the concept of the Moore plane, in a less
 atmospheric manner?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A characteristic of the circle map is that when two parameter sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta^{\prime}=\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 are close enough to one-another, then the two different iterated sequences
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

 are also close to one-another.
 Perhaps it is possible to think of a tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 at each point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

? Of course, this is possible for 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

; the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\eta}\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is well-defined for the Euclidean plane; the tangent space is a vector
 space itself.
 The Euclidean metric can be given as a metric tensor on the tangent space.
 Can this idea be carried over to the circle map, where distances are provided
 by the similarity of sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

? Is this even a coherent idea, given that some sequences are periodic,
 while others are chaotic? It might not be, but let's at least try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, a review of the symmetries of the map.
 The circle map is taken as the iterated equation 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n+1}=x_{n}+\omega-K\sin2\pi x_{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 real, and the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 real as well.
 By periodicity of sine, the regions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega+m$
\end_inset

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 can be trivially remapped into 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1$
\end_inset

.
 This mapping is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\mapsto\omega-m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\mapsto x_{n}+mn$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\lfloor \omega\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 In other words, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\omega$
\end_inset

, just subtract 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor \omega\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 from the rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and then add 
\begin_inset Formula $n\left\lfloor \omega\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The iteration is also symmetric about 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 This is obtained by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\mapsto1-\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\mapsto n-x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the unique region is that of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1/2$
\end_inset

, with the other regions mapping into it, nearly trivially.
 However, the pictures are prettier when they are symmetric, and so, as
 a general rule, the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1$
\end_inset

 is depicted in the various pictures.
 The map is not symmetric about 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

; the sequences for 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm K$
\end_inset

 cannot be remapped into one-another.
 Yet, remarkably, the general behavior is remarkably similar.
 This is examined more closely below.
 Most of this text will be focused on the square region 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le K\le1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1$
\end_inset

, except as otherwise noted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixing parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

, the goal is to explore orbits for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega^{\prime},K^{\prime}\right)=\left(\omega+\delta\omega,K+\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega\ll1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta K\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 This effectively defines a tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and so, with this setup, it makes sense of talking of metrics on 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\eta}$
\end_inset

.
 Writing the nearby sequence as 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n+1}=y_{n}+\omega+\delta\omega-\left(K+\delta K\right)\sin2\pi y_{n}$
\end_inset

, one can then imagine applying the conventional Banach space sequence metric,
 in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\Vert x-y\right\Vert _{p}=\left(\sum_{n}\left|x_{n}-y_{n}\right|^{p}\right)^{1/p}
\]

\end_inset

There are several problems with this naive aproach.
 Foremost is that there is no reason to think that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert x-y\right\Vert _{p}<\infty$
\end_inset

 anywhere.
 In the worst case, the winding numbers differ, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}/n=\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

 and likewise for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}y_{n}/n=\Omega_{y}$
\end_inset

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}\ne\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x_{n}-y_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 would be of order 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(n\left|\Omega_{x}-\Omega_{y}\right|\right)$
\end_inset

 and the sum diverges badly.
 A less terrible case would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}=\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

, with one orbit chatoic, and the other periodic.
 In this case, the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x_{n}-y_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 would then be at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 at each step.
 This still leads to a divergent sum.
 A fairly gentle case would be where the two orbits progress in lockstep;
 this might lead to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|x_{n}-y_{n}\right|=\epsilon$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the two orbits converge to something that has a fixed offset.
 Again, the sum diverges.
 A minor variation of this would be the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is replaced with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{n}$
\end_inset

 having a periodic behavior.
 The sum is still divergent.
 The only case where there is hope is where both sequences converge to the
 same orbit (periodic or chaotic).
 It seems unlike that this would ever be the case, although it is perhaps
 possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different issue is that, in numerical explorations, the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

 cannot be taken directly, and one must instead work with sums that are
 explicitly finite, and make arguments about how they might extrapolate.
 With this in mind, define an alternate metric, having the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{p;N}\left(x-y\right)=\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N}\left|x_{n}-y_{n}\right|^{p}\right)^{1/p}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{p}\left(x-y\right)=\lim_{N\to\infty}d_{p;N}\left(x-y\right)
\]

\end_inset

Is this expression well-defined? Reviewing the same cases as above, its
 clear that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}\ne\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

 case still leads to a divergent sum.
 The sum would be 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N^{2}\left|\Omega_{x}-\Omega_{y}\right|\right)$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 in front is not enough to restore order.
 One concludes that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}=\infty$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}\ne\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 However, there should be other cases, where orbits with different periods
 are being compared, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}=\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

 holds.
 Here, the sum should be well-behaved, and the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}\left(x-y\right)$
\end_inset

 should exist, and be finite.
 It seems well-defined and finite, at least when comparing cases where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{y}=\Omega_{x}$
\end_inset

 holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each orbit difference 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}-y_{n}$
\end_inset

 resulted from a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 offset by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta=\left(\delta\omega,\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 When is it possible to take the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta\to0$
\end_inset

 in a meaningful way? It seems that this limit should exist if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is periodic, and not at the edge of a chaotic transition.
 Then all other nearby orbits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 should have the same period, and behave in the same way.
 What's more, it seems reasonable to expect a linear behavior in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}\left(a\delta\eta\right)\approx ad_{p}\left(\delta\eta\right)$
\end_inset

, at least when 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta$
\end_inset

 is small enough.
 However, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is chaotic, then it would be plausible to argue that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta\to0$
\end_inset

 does not exist, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}\left(\delta\eta\right)$
\end_inset

 might not be smooth or even continuous.
 We conclude that when the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta\to0$
\end_inset

 does exist, then a tangent plane 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\eta}$
\end_inset

 exists, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}$
\end_inset

 becomes a linear metric on that tangent plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, the questions that seem to arise are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For which points 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \delta\eta\right\Vert _{p}<\infty$
\end_inset

? What is the nature of this set? Is it countable? Does it have a measure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For which points 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}<\infty$
\end_inset

? We've concluded above that this should hold when the winding number is
 locally unchanged; for example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is in one of the Arnold tongues.
 What is the structure of these regions? What is the correct way to talk
 about this structure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For which points 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}$
\end_inset

 a smooth (approximately linear) function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\eta$
\end_inset

? We've concluded above that this should hold when 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a periodic orbit that is not on the cusp chaos, Can this
 be demonstrated more carefully and clearly?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These questions should now make the inspiration of the Moore plane a bit
 more obvious: any point 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{p}=\infty$
\end_inset

 is metrically disconnected from it's neighbors.
 One can use this to infer a topology, with that topology being discrete,
 at such points.
 But this is not all; other nearby questions easily suggest themselves.

\begin_layout Subsection
Computational remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All figures in this text use pixel coordinates that place 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega\le1$
\end_inset

 along the x-axis, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le K\le1$
\end_inset

 along the y-axis, unless otherwise noted.
 As a general rule, each sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 depends on the initial starting point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 However, as a general rule, we are interested in the structure that remains
 independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

, the structure of the asymptotic sequence for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 To hide the dependency on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

, each pixel shows an average over many sequences, each with a different
 randomly sampled (with uniform distribution) initial value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 For most of these images, hundreds, thousands and sometimes tens of thousands
 of different initial points are used.
 A speckle pattern can be seen in many of the images: this speckling washes
 out as more samples are taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All pictures use a common color coding when illustrating form function 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f\left(\left\{ x_{n}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

.
 This coding is that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\lesssim0.05$
\end_inset

 in black, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\approx0.25$
\end_inset

 in blue, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\approx0.5$
\end_inset

 in green, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\approx0.75$
\end_inset

 in yellow, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\gtrsim0.95$
\end_inset

 in red.
 As a general rule, the reported quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 are almost never negative, unless noted otherwise.
 Values with 
\begin_inset Formula $f>1$
\end_inset

 can occur in many of the images, these are coded in strictly red.
 This color coding is used throughout, and is occasionally scaled by a constant
 scale factor, as reported on a case-by-case basis.
 Images are either 800x800 pixels, or 1000x1000 pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Winding number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Associated to each sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a winding number 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Omega=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{x_{n}}{n}
\]

\end_inset

This is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Winding-number"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The winding number is, in general, well-defined, since, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x_{n+1}-x_{n}\right|\le\left|\omega\right|+\left|K\right|\le2$
\end_inset

, at least when limited to the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\omega,K\le1$
\end_inset

, as is usually the case for these images.
 Thus, on first priciples, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{n}\le\left|x_{n}\right|\le\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\left|x_{n+1}-x_{n}\right|\le n\left(\left|\omega\right|+\left|K\right|\right)
\]

\end_inset

from which one deduces
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\le\Omega\le\left|\omega\right|+\left|K\right|
\]

\end_inset

Experimentally, it appears that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0\le\Omega\le1
\]

\end_inset

almost always.

Poincare recurrence time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The winding number property of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 means that the sequence is perenially increasing, and never returns to
 the same value twice.
 Yet, periodicity is forced by the perturbation term 
\begin_inset Formula $K\sin2\pi x_{n}$
\end_inset

, which remaps each 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 to the unit interval.
 This sequence, call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the associated reduced sequence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{n}=x_{n}-\left\lfloor x_{n}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

, is recurrent.
 (Think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

u
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.) It is typically recurent in one of two ways: either the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 will settle down to asymptotically periodic orbits as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

, or it will not, chaoticaly visiting most or all of the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One classic technique for studying recurrence is to experimentally determine
 the Poincare recurrence time.
 This is defined as the smallest number of iterations 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 such that, for sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, one finds 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|u_{n+\tau}-u_{n}\right|<\epsilon
\]

\end_inset

for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 That is, a given orbit returns 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to a point that was visited before.
 This is shown in figure

This figure shows the Poincare recurrence time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 encoded in color.
 The color of black corresponds to recurrence times of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\lesssim10$
\end_inset

, green to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\approx125$
\end_inset

 and red for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\gtrsim250$
\end_inset

.
 A value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0.003$
\end_inset

 was used in this image.
 As a general rule, varying 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 results in images that all look more or less identical (at least when 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is small enough.) The distinct boundary between the red bar at the bottom,
 and the rest of the image, corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1/2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to the point where the (initial) slope of the term 
\begin_inset Formula $K\sin\left(2\pi x\right)$
\end_inset

 exceeds unity.
 This large slope can send iterated points flying, and marks the onset of
 the chaotic effects.
 The image itself is 800x800 pixels in size.
 A higher resolution image, 1920x3840 can be found on the website.
 It's quite something; one can fall into the fine details.

\end_inset

, as long as it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

not too small
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 This is because it can take a long time for 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{n}$
\end_inset

 to settle into a periodic orbit; thus, if one attempts to measure the recurrenc
e time before the orbit has settled, one will have poor measurements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement technique used in this figure was to pre-iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $n=90$
\end_inset

 times, and then use 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{n}=u_{90}$
\end_inset

 as the initial starting point.
 Iteration continued for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 more steps, until 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|u_{90+\tau}-u_{90}\right|<\epsilon$
\end_inset

 was satisfied.
 To get a better approximation, iteration continued for 500 more steps,
 and an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 was taken.
 The figure shows no particularly visible dependence on the starting point
 (the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=90$
\end_inset

 point), on the extended number of iterations, or on the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 There is, presumably, some dependence, but this is not characterized.
 There is a strong dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 and so, to get well-behaved values, the recurance time (for each pixel)
 is averaged over hundreds of different randomly selected 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 values.
 Close examination of the image reveals speckling; this speckling goes away
 as more averages per pixel are taken.

 increases along the 45-degree diagonal, extendeding to the upper right.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0$

 in the lower-left corner, increasing to the lower right, along a diagonal.
 Due to periodicity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 to

 Note that each individual square is mirror-symmetric about the 45 degree
 axis; thus, the rest of the plane can be gotten by mirroring along the
 45 and 90 degree axes, and tiling the plane.
 Higher

 The image is not symmetric under the inversion

\begin_layout Subsection
Periodic and chaotic orbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orbits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 decompose into roughly two kinds: the asymptotically periodic orbits, which
 approach a periodic limit sequence, and the chaotic orbits, which visit
 points on the unit interval, according to the invariant measure.
 Of course, periodic orbits can be thought of as corresponding to an invariant
 measure having a countable number of Dirac delta functions located at the
 limit points.
 Lets take some care with definitions.
 A limit cycle of period 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 points 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le v_{k}<1$
\end_inset

 for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le k<p$
\end_inset

.
 It is a limit when, for each 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}u_{np+k}=v_{k}
\]

\end_inset

The limit is approached with varying speeds; the speed of the approach is
 termed the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lyapunov exponent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will be explored elsewhere.

\begin_layout Subsection
Bin-counting and measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A deeper and more sophisticated perspective is provided through the method
 of bin-counting or histogramming.
 This enables a simple numerical technique for determining the period of
 an orbit, independently of using the Poincare recurrence time to obtain
 it.
 It also leads directly to the concept of invarient measures, a central
 concept from ergodic theory.
 Invariant measures consisting only of discrete points correspond to periodic
 orbits; invariant measure that have continuous regions correspond to chaotic
 orbits.
 The correspondence is sketched below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numerical approach provides a good place to launch from.
 Divide the unit interval into 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 bins.
 Several hundred to several thousand bins are enough to show something interesti
ng.
 For each iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}$
\end_inset

, compute the bin number 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\lfloor My_{n}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 and increment the bincount on that bin.
 Orbits of period 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 will typically populate 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 bins.
 Near period bifurcations (saddle points), the Lyapunov exponent will be
 vanishing, and orbits will always engage in a slow walk, slowly converging
 to the limit cycle.
 Thus, for periodic orbits near period bifurcations, there will be some
 slop, as counts spill over into bins neighboring the limit cycle.
 This can be mitigated by pre-iterating: counting does not start until some
 minimum number of iterations have been done.
 This allows the periodic orbits to settle down and converge to their limit
 cycles.
 Counting the number of non-empty bins (rejecting the low-count bins as
 noise) provides a direct measure of the period.
 For a periodic orbit, each non-empty bin should be visited the same number
 of times; any spill-over or deficit should be ascribed to iteration near
 saddle points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chaotic orbits do not visit a finite set of distinct points, but instead
 are ergodic over a measureable set.
 The idea of the invariant measure is described more closely below; from
 the bin-counting point of view, it means that a large fraction of the bins,
 or possibly all of them are visited during iteration.
 This holds true, even if the bins are made infinitessimally tiny.
 The support of the measure is the fraction of the unit interval on which
 the measure is non-vanishing; in bin-counting terms, it is the fraction
 of all bins that are non-empty.
 The support is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

This figure shows the fraction of non-empty bins obtained after bin-counting.
 The standard color map is used: red indicates that all bins have been visited,
 green indicates half, and black indicates few or none.
 The non-empty bins correspond to intervals on which the measure is non-zero;
 that is, where the measure has support.
 The support is (effectively) independent of the number of bins used (after
 ignoring periodic orbits).
 This particular image was generated with 1000 bins; thus, blue corresponds
 to roughly 250 occupied bins; deep blue extending down to perhaps 100.
 This means that almost all parts of the map with periodic orbits appear
 in the black regions; parts of the map that have period-doubled up into
 orbit lengths of 100 are extremely thin, as noted in the previous figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 a few hundred bins or more.

\begin_layout Standard
Iteration of the circle map generally resembles that of the Feigenbaum map,
 including the transition from the period-doubled to the chaotic region.
 As the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $p\to\infty$
\end_inset

 is reached, the visited points spread out into a non-discrete measure.
 The bin-counts provide an approximation to that measure.
 Suppose there are 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 bins, and one has iterated for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 steps.
 At the end of counting, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{m}$
\end_inset

 be the count in bin 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Normalizing by the total count, one has a normalized bincount of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{m}=c_{m}/N$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m}\nu_{m}=1$
\end_inset

.
 The bin numbers can be likewise normalized: write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}=\nu_{m}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=m/M$
\end_inset

.
 The continuum limit is then taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $M\to\infty$
\end_inset

 (the width of each bin is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/M$
\end_inset

).
 For finite 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, this just gives a scattering of points on the unit interval.
 The limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 gives the proper invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}\to\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is a measure in the sense that the integral

Informally, the measure can be understood as a single slice through the
 Feigenbaum map.
 In the periodic regions, it will be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(x\right)=\sum_{k}\delta\left(x-x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 where the sum ranges over the points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the cycle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function.
 In the chaotic regions, the measure will have measureable support, that
 is, it will be (almost surely) non-zero on a collection of sub-intervals
 of the unit interval.
 This was already noted and presented in figure

The measure is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because it corresponds to the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue of one, for
 the corresponding transfer operator.
 Wandering a bit off-topic, lets sketch this for completeness.
 For any given iterated function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, define the transfer operator (alternately called the Frobenius–Peron operator)
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{f}:\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{f}g\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x\in f^{-1}\left(y\right)}\frac{1}{\left|f^{\prime}\left(x\right)\right|}g\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

This busy expression can be understood as follows.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suitable space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of functions on the unit interval, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
 More on what is meant by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 In the meantime, one may take 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 denotes the derivative; the reciprocal can be recognized as the Jacobian.
 The Frobenius–Peron operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{f}$
\end_inset

 is an operator, in that it maps functions to functions.
 As a operator, it has a spectrum: in general a spectrum with discrete parts,
 as well as continuous parts; all of the usual considerations about the
 spectra of operators apply, in general.
 For suitably tame function spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

, the largest eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{f}$
\end_inset

 will be one, corresponding to a unique eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}_{f}\mu=\mu
\]

\end_inset

This eigenfunction can be identified as the invariant measure of the iterated
 map.
 It is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{f}$
\end_inset

 doesn't change it.
 It is a

\begin_inset Formula $n$

'th iterate of

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f^{n}=f\circ f\circ\cdots\circ f$
\end_inset

 as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 composed 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 times with itself.
 Then, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, the probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $a<f^{n}\left(x\right)<b$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{a}^{b}\mu\left(x\right)dx$

.
 Working with spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$

 results in an operator with a discrete spectrum.

The situation is not always so simple.
 Working with Hilbert spaces or Banach spaces for

\begin_layout Subsection
Measures and Recurrence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measure and the recurrence time can each be derived from the other.
 More precisely, they are reciprocals of one another.
 The relationship is stochastic, rather than dynamic or deterministic.
 It can be derived as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the steps to needed to obtain the recurrence time.
 One selects a starting point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

, with some 
\begin_inset Formula $n\gg1$
\end_inset

 so that one is assured that any transients altering the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 have decayed away.
 How large should this be? There is a formal way to estimate this; a sketch
 follows.
 The transients correspond to eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset

 of the Frobenius–Perron operator; that is, the decaying eigenfunctions
 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\lambda}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}e_{\lambda}=\lambda e_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 The largest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|<1$
\end_inset

 is the one that limits convergence the most.
 To see this, expand any given density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 in terms of the eigenfunctions, by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)=\sum_{\lambda}a_{\lambda}e_{\lambda}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for some constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 After 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 iterations of the transfer operator, one gets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{C}^{n}\rho=\sum_{\lambda}a_{\lambda}\lambda^{n}e_{\lambda}=a_{0}\mu+\lambda_{1}^{n}a_{1}e_{1}+\mathcal{O}\left(\lambda_{2}^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 where the eigenvalues were ordered such that 
\begin_inset Formula $1>\left|\lambda_{1}\right|>\left|\lambda_{2}\right|>\cdots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the invariant measure, as before.
 One then looks for a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 sufficiently large that 
\begin_inset Formula $1\gg\left|\lambda_{1}\right|^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The log of the first eigenvalue is just the Lyapunov exponent; this is
 clear by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda_{1}\right|^{n}=\exp n\log\left|\lambda_{1}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Such a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is sufficient to guarantee that the the transients in the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 have died away, to order 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(\lambda_{1}^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Keep in mind that, near saddle points, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 might be very close to one, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 might need to be large, there (possibly hundreds or more, in numerical
 practice.) In most other cases, taking 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to be a few dozen is probably sufficient.
 Equivalently, the Lyapunov exponent is very close to zero, near saddle
 points.
 For seat-of-the-pants calculations, all this theoretical concern can be
 skipped; just take 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for be a few hundred for generating pixmaps.
 Computers are fast; this is not an issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having obtained such a starting point, one then iterates further, looking
 for a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n+\tau}\in\left[x_{n}-\epsilon,x_{n}+\epsilon\right]$
\end_inset

 for the chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 Even though iteration is a deterministic process, we can treat it as if
 it were stochastic, and ask the question, when might the above membership
 hold? The answer is given precisely by the measure.
 A point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 randomly selected from the unit interval will land within the interval
 centered on point 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 with the probability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(x\in\left[y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon\right]\right)=\int_{y-\epsilon}^{y+\epsilon}\mu\left(s\right)ds
\]

\end_inset

Inverting this, one concludes that, on average, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1/p\left(x\in\left[x_{n}-\epsilon,x_{n}+\epsilon\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 or, explicitly integrating,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau=\frac{1}{\int_{x_{n}-\epsilon}^{x_{n}+\epsilon}\mu\left(s\right)ds}
\]

\end_inset

This is readily computed for any chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 (and any seat-of-the-pants 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).

 averaging over a large set of starting points.

False Start: Laplacian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to imagine that one way to explore neighboring values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 is to take the point-wise Laplacian of the orbits.
 This proves to be a not very good idea, as will be revealed shortly.
 Nontheless, its just interesting enough to deserve a mention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 5-point discrete Laplacian, at each iteration, can be defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nabla^{2}x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)=4x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega-\delta\omega,K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega+\delta\omega,K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega,K-\delta K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)
\]

\end_inset

for some suitably small 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega,\delta K\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 One then considers the average Laplacian, over many iterations:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{N}\left(\omega,K\right)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\nabla^{2}x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 show the result.
 This sounds like a good idea, until one realizes that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{N}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 changes sign, when one crosses a boundary.
 Intuitively, one might say that taking a derivative to the left is minus
 that of taking a derivative to the right.
 The same for the discrete Laplacian.
 As a kind of second derivative, one could think of it as being immune to
 such awkward behavior.
 This is not so, when it straddles a boundary.
 This can be belabored in greater detail, if one wishes.
 If not, then skip the next few sentences.
 They don't say anything important.
 So, for example, assume that one can find a region where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)\approx x_{n}\left(\omega-\delta\omega,K\right)\approx x_{n}\left(\omega+\delta\omega,K\right)\approx x_{n}\left(\omega,K-\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

 but that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)\ne x_{n}\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

 in a strong way.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)\approx x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Consider shifting over to the next pixel, located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 At this pixel, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}x_{n}\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)\approx-\nabla^{2}x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 and so likewise 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(\omega,K+\delta K\right)\approx-L\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In more abstract terms, the first derivative of the Heaviside step function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The second derivative is 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{\prime}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 which is a pair of spikes, one going positive, one going negative, with
 the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{\prime}\left(x\right)=-\delta^{\prime}\left(-x\right)$
\end_inset

: the sign flips.
 Dang.
 This kind of nasty behavior near edges makes the Laplacian less than ideal
 as an experimental tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\omega,\delta K=0.001$
\end_inset

 were used in generating these images.
 This corresponds to the pixel-size, center to center.
 Using smaller values would risk missing significant changes in between
 pixels.
 Using larger values has the effect of blurring out details.
 Thus, this size appears to be more or less optimal.

The issue of the Laplacian changing signs, depending on which side of an
 edge one is sitting on, can be avoided by taking the absolute value, before
 summming.
 This replaces the Laplacian by a kind of direction-averaged gradient.
 This is direction-averaged absolute gradient is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=0}^{M}\left|x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)-x_{n}\left(\omega+\delta\eta\cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{M}\right),K+\delta\eta\sin\left(\frac{2\pi m}{M}\right)\right)\right|

\end_inset

The five-point formula is obtained when 
\begin_inset Formula $M=4$
\end_inset

, so that the sine and cosine just sample to the left, right, above and
 below (of course, the Laplacian avoids the absolute value in the above.)
 The absolute value above allows 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{n}$

 to be understood as a first derivative, instead of a second derivative.
 The infinitessimal form of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

whose infinitessimal form should correspond to something similar to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{p}f\mapsto\left|\partial\left|f\right|^{p}/\partial\eta\right|^{1/p}$
\end_inset

 or something similar; I'm too lazy to scratch out the details.
 At any rate, this would be a weighted multiple of the basic form.

The results for 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In the mode-locking regions, we expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)\to0$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

 and so we should find 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{p;N}x\left(\omega,K\right)\approx0$
\end_inset

 in these regions.
 This is confirmed in both figures.
 The edges of the mode-locking regions are also clearly visible; it appears
 that, roughly speaking 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{1;N}x\left(\omega,K\right)\approx1$
\end_inset

 in these regions, and sometimes much higher.
 This is obtained by reading off the color code in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:gradient-l1-sum"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This makes sense: the unlocked regions should correspond to chaotic orbits,
 in which the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 visit the entire interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Nearby 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 points should correspond to different and uncorrelated orbits; thus, one
 should expect, on average, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)\approx1$
\end_inset

 for these orbits, which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{1;N}x\left(\omega,K\right)\approx1$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The bright red regions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:gradient-l1-sum"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 are therefore more interesting.
 They suggest regions where the individual sum components 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{n}\left(\omega,K\right)$
\end_inset

 have to be considerably larger than one.
 Comparing the same to the winding number chart in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Winding-number"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it appears that the winding number is quite tame.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 always reverts to the mean, so that, on average, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\approx n\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we conclude that, in the red regions, although the average behavior
 is quite tame, the sequence makes large excusions from the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite peculiar is the diamond in the center of the figure.
 It is quite unlike any other region of the map (except, of course, those
 regions where it reappears streched and squashed.) The most remarkable property
 is how undifferentiated it is: there is no visible small-scale structure.
 In this sense, perhaps, one should say tat the orbits in this region truly
 are uncorrelated and random.
 This is fundamentally different from the other colored regions, which suggest
 the presence of structure.
 Comparing to the winding number chart, it is seen again that the winding
 number behaves quite tamely in this diamond.
 As the lower part of the diamond is quite red, one concludes that the there
 are large excursions there, as well.
 However, comparing to the recurrence chart 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Poincare-recurrence-time"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the orbits in the diamond can be seen to have very low recurrence times.
 They would seem to be periodic with very short periods.
 This would seem to point at a contradiction or a paradox: from the winding
 number chart, one concludes, as before, that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}\approx n\Omega$
\end_inset

 in this region.
 From the recurrance chart, the periods appear to be all short, and so there
 is not enough time for a large excursion to occur.
 Perhaps te resolution to this paradox is that the recurrence time is being
 measured in a misleading way? Or rather, that the recurrence time cannot
 be taken as an accurate proxy for the period?

 This has the effect of highlighting the regions where

 is small.
