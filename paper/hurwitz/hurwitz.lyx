\layout Abstract

This paper sketches a technique for improving the rate of convergence of
 a general oscillatory sequence, and then applies this series acceleration
 algorithm to the polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta function.
 As such, it may be taken as  an extension of the techniques given by Borwein's
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

An efficient algorithm for computing the Riemann zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor95,Bor00-A}

\end_inset 

, to more general series.
 The algorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)$
\end_inset 

 for general values of complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and the region of complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 values given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z^{2}/(z-1)\right|<4$
\end_inset 

.
 This region includes the the Hurwitz zeta 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s,q)$
\end_inset 

 for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\le q\le3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 By using the duplication formula and the inversion formula, the range of
 convergence for the polylogarithm may be extended to the entire complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, and so the algorithms described here allow for the evaluation of
 the polylogarithm for all complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 values.
 Similarly, the Hurwitz zeta can be extended to the whole real interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 The speed of the algorithm is significantly superior to a Taylor's series
 for the evaluation of the Hurwitz zeta; quadratically so when a large number
 of digits of precision is required.
 The speed is approximately linear in the number of operations required,
 although it does require the computation of integers raised to a complex
 power, which is generally a non-trivial and slow numerical operation.
 The primary, concrete result of this paper is an algorithm allows the explorati
on of the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast algorithms are
 otherwise unavailable.

Introduction
\layout Standard

This note sketches a technique for improving the rate of convergence of
 a general oscillatory series, and then applies this technique to the computatio
n of the polylogarithm, and, in particular, to the Hurwitz zeta function.
 It essentially generalizes an algorithm given by Peter Borwein for computing
 the Riemann zeta function.
 The principle result is an algorithm that efficiently obtains values of
 the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta function may be defined as 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:Hurwitz zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 This series may be directly summed for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>1$
\end_inset 

, although, for high-precision work, convergence is annoyingly slow unless
 one has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\gtrsim2$
\end_inset 

.
 A globally convergent series was given by Helmut Hasse in 1930
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Has30}

\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\frac{1}{s-1}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)(q+k)^{1-s}\label{eq:Hasse series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Although technically convergent in the critical strip, in practice, the
 convergence is abysmally slow on the critical strip.
 Since the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis can be phrased in terms of the
 values of the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical strip, it is of some
 interest to have a fast algorithm for computing high-precision values of
 this function in this region.
 There seems to be a paucity of work in this area.
 There is a discussion of fast algorithms for Dirichlet L-functions in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Sle04}

\end_inset 

 (but this techniques seems to be limited in scope ????).
 
\layout Standard

A not unreasonable algorithm may be given by considering a Taylor's series
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 Expanding about 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset 

, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\frac{1}{q^{s}}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-q\right)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+n-1\\
n\end{array}\right)\zeta(s+n)\label{eq:Hurwitz taylor}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 It is not hard to show that the sum on the right is convergent for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|q\right|<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Alternately, an expansion may be made about 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1/2$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(s,q+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-q\right)^{n}\left(\begin{array}{c}
s+n-1\\
n\end{array}\right)\left(2^{s+n}-1\right)\zeta(s+n)\]

\end_inset 

 It may be shown that the above has a region of convergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|q\right|<1/2$
\end_inset 

.
 Either of these expansions provide a computable expression for the Hurwitz
 zeta function that is convergent on the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

-plane (minus, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset 

, and taking the appropriate limit, via l'Hopital's rule, when 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a non-positive integer).
 The principal drawback to the use of these sums for high-precision calculations
 is the need for many high-precision evaluations of the Riemann zeta; the
 compute time can grow exponentially as the number of required digits is
 increased, especially when 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 approaches the radius of convergence of the sums.
 It is the poor performance of these sums that motivates the development
 of this paper.
\layout Standard

The Hurwitz zeta may be expressed in terms of the polylogarithm
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Lew81}

\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:polylog definition}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 by means of Jonquière's identity
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[Section 7.12.2]{Lew81}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Jon1889}

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\zeta(1-s,q)\label{eq:poly-hur relation}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 and so one might search for good algorithms for polylogarithms.
 Wood
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Wood92}

\end_inset 

 provides a extensive review of the means of computing the polylogarithm,
 but limits himself to real values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Crandall
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Cra06}

\end_inset 

 discusses evaluating the polylogarithm on the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, but limits himself to integer values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, there appears to be a similar paucity of general algorithms for the
 polylogarithm as well.
 The series defining the polylogarithm may be directly evaluated when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, although direct evaluation becomes quite slow when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\gtrsim0.95$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\lesssim2$
\end_inset 

.
 There do not seem to be any published algorithms that may be applied on
 the critical strip.
\layout Standard

The primary effort of this paper is to take the algorithm given by Borwein
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor95,Bor00-A}

\end_inset 

, which is a simple Padé-approximant type algorithm, and generalize it to
 the polylogarithm.
 The result is a relatively small finite sum that approximates the polylogarithm
, and whose error, or difference from the exact value, can be precisely
 characterized and bounded.
 Increased precision is easily obtainable by evaluating a slightly larger
 sum; one may obtain roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $4N$
\end_inset 

 bits of precision by evaluating a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

 terms.
 The sum may be readily evaluated for just about any value 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, it is convergent only in a limited region of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, and specifically, is only convergent when 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|<4\]

\end_inset 

 This is sufficient for evaluating the Hurwitz zeta for general complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1$
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any simple and efficient way
 of extending this result to the general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, at least not for general values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

.
 Using duplication and reflection formulas, one may extend the algorithm
 to the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane; however, this requires the independent evaluation of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz taylor}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The development of this paper proceeds as follows.
 First, a certain specific integral representation is given for the polylogarith
m.
 This representation is such that a certain trick, here called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the Borwein trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, may be applied, to expressed the integral as a polynomial plus a small
 error term.
 This is followed by a sketch of a generalization of the trick to the convergenc
e acceleration of general oscillatory series.
 The next section selects a specific polynomial, and the error term of the
 resulting approximation is precisely bounded.
 This is followed by a brief review of the duplication formula for the Hurwitz
 zeta, and a short discussion of ways in which this numerical algorithm
 may be tested for correctness.
 The algorithm has been implemented by the author using the Gnu Multiple
 Precision arithmetic library
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{GMP}

\end_inset 

, and is available on request, under the terms of the LGPL license.
 The paper concludes with some intriguing images of the polylogarithm and
 the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical strip.
 
\layout Section

The Polylogarithm
\layout Standard

The polylogarithm has a non-trivial analytic structure.
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, it has a branch cut on the positive real axis, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<z<+\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The location of the branch-point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 is, as is always the case with branch points, the cause of limited convergence
 of analytic series in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 This is noted here, as this branch point has a direct impact on the algorithm,
 preventing convergence in its vicinity.
 The polylogarithm has many interesting properties, which are not reviewed
 here.
\layout Standard

The development of the algorithm requires the following integral representation.
\layout Lemma

The polylogarithm has the integral representation 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Proof

This identity is easily obtained by inserting the integral representation
 of the Gamma function:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z) & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n^{s}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-u}u^{s-1}du\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z^{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-nt}t^{s-1}dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(ze^{-t}\right)^{n}\, dt\\
 & = & \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{s-1}\left[\frac{ze^{-t}}{1-ze^{-t}}\right]\, dt\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 and then finally substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-\log y$
\end_inset 

 in the last integral.
 Although this derivation casually interchanges the order of integration
 and summation, one may appeal to general arguments about analytic continuation
 to argue that the final result is generally valid, provided one is careful
 to navigate about the branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

The Borwein trick
\layout Standard

The Borwein trick uses the integral form to find a simple, finite sum that
 approximates the desired value arbitrarily well.
 The trick consists of two steps.
 The first is to write the above integral in the form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\xi(s,z) & = & \frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\nonumber \\
 & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{1}{f(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{f(y)-f(1/z)}{1-yz}\,\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}dy\label{eq:Borwein trick}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 The second step is to find a sequence of polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 to be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset 

, such that the integral on the right hand side can be evaluated as a simple,
 finite sum, while the left hand side can be shown to bounded arbitrarily
 close to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

.
 The right hand side may be easily evaluated, by employing the following
 theorem.
\layout Theorem

Given a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\frac{p_{n}(y)-p_{n}(1/z)}{1-yz}\label{eq:r_n definition}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 is again a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(1/z)\ne0$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Proof

Write the polynomial as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 assume only a general series: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}c_{k}y^{k}\label{eq:r_n series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

, one immediately obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=a_{0}-p_{n}(1/z)$
\end_inset 

.
 Higher coefficients are obtained by equating derivatives: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
r_{n}^{(k)}(y)=\frac{1}{1-yz}\left[p_{n}^{(k)}(y)+kzr_{n}^{(k-1)}(y)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}^{(k)}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset 

'th derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset 

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

 in the above, one obtains the recurrence relation 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}=a_{k}+zc_{k-1}$
\end_inset 

 which is trivially solvable as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{k}\frac{a_{j}}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 From this, it is easily seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}=0$
\end_inset 

 and more precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n+m}=0$
\end_inset 

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge0$
\end_inset 

.
 This concludes the proof that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 is a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

This result may be immediately employed in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Borwein trick}

\end_inset 

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+\frac{z}{p_{n}(1/z)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{(k+1)^{s}}\label{eq:Polylog general estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 To obtain a good approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

, one needs to find a polynomial sequence such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 goes to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset 

 for the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 of interest.
 That is, one seeks to make 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}(1/z)}\,\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\,\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\label{eq:xi integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 as small as possible.
 One possible sequence, based on the Bernoulli process or Gaussian distribution,
 is explored in a subsequent section.

Convergence Acceleration of Oscillatory Series 
\layout Standard

For the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)=y^{n}$
\end_inset 

, the technique corresponds to Euler's method for the convergence acceleration
 of an alternating series
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[eqn 3.6.27]{A&S}

\end_inset 

; a particularly efficient algorithm for Euler's method is given by van
 Wijngaarden
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Pre88}

\end_inset 

.
 Polynomials that provide much more powerful series acceleration are discussed
 by Cohen 
\emph on 
etal
\emph default 

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Coh00}

\end_inset 

, but again in the context of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

; these include the Tchebysheff orthogonal polynomials considered by Borwein,
 which do a rather good job of minimizing the integrand of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 In a certain sense, an alternating series can be considered to be a series
 from which an explicit factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}$
\end_inset 

 has been factored out, for the very special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, one is lead to ask if one can find series acceleration methods for
 more general oscillatory series, where the oscillatory component can be
 thought of as going as 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}$
\end_inset 

 for some root of unity 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The Euler method applied to the Hurwitz zeta function essentially leads
 to the Hasse series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hasse series}

\end_inset 

.
 This may be seen by noting that the inner sum is just a forward difference:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)(q+k)^{1-s}=\triangle^{n}q^{1-s}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle$
\end_inset 

 is the forward difference operator.
 The Hasse series has improved convergence in that the result is globally
 convergent, whereas the traditional series representation of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

 is not.
 However, a quick numerical experiment will show that the Hasse series does
 not converge rapidly, especially in the critical strip.
\layout Standard

The poor convergence of these traditional techniques motivates the development
 of this paper.
 Strictly speaking, the slow convergence can be attributed to the fact that
 the naive series representations 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog definition}

\end_inset 

 are not strictly alternating series, as would be required to justify the
 application of the Euler method.
 Instead, the series are a superposition of oscillatory terms; for the polylogar
ithm, an explicit oscillation coming from 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n}=\left|z\right|^{n}e^{in\arg z}$
\end_inset 

 and a slower oscillation coming from 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}=n^{-\sigma}e^{-i\tau\log n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, what one needs is a theory of sequence acceleration not for alternating
 series, but for oscillatory series.
 The polylogarithm approximation represents the 
\emph on 
ad-hoc
\emph default 
 development of a special case for such a general theory.
\layout Standard

A loose sketch of a possible general theory is presented below.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset 

 is some more or less arbitrary sequence of numbers, oscillatory in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, and that one wishes to compute the sum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 but that one wants to apply convergence acceleration techniques to its
 evaluation.
 If the leading component of oscillation is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}\sim\cos n\theta$
\end_inset 

, then one makes the ansatz that there must exist some dual series 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset 

 oscillating as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}\sim\sin n\theta$
\end_inset 

 to give 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{n}=c_{n}+is_{n}\sim e^{in\theta}$
\end_inset 

.
 One may then consider a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=e^{in(\pi-\theta)}e_{n}$
\end_inset 

 and consider the  summation of an alternating series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{n}a_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 By construction, the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are now presumed to be relatively tame, so that series acceleration techniques
 can be applied.
 This trick may be applied to any oscillatory sequence; one need not know
 a precise or 
\emph on 
a priori
\emph default 
 value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset 

; one need only guess at a reasonable value, based on the data at hand.
 
\layout Standard

Alternately, one may consider replacing the forward difference operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle b_{n}=b_{n+1}-b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle_{q}b_{n}=b_{n+1}-qb_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Straightforward manipulations lead to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z}{1-qz}\right)^{m+1}\triangle_{q}^{m}b_{0}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}b_{n}\]

\end_inset 

 with the traditional Euler's series regained by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 Assuming that the oscillatory part 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is known, or can be approximately guessed at from the period of the oscillation
, then choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $q=-1/z$
\end_inset 

 should make the left hand side an accelerated series for the right hand
 side.
 However, there are more powerful techniques.
\layout Standard

Suppose one is interested in the sum
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}b_{n}\label{eq: geo series}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 In general, one is interested in general sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 Suppose, however, that the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are expressible as moments, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b_{n}=\int_{0}^{1}y^{n}g(y)dy\]

\end_inset 

 for some function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 is still fairly general (subject to constraints discussed below), this
 assumption does not overly restrict the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 If the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are expressible as moments, then one has
\begin_inset Formula \[
S(z)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{g(y)}{1-yz}\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 Applying the Borwein trick, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S(z)=S_{n}(z)+\xi(z)\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{p_{n}(y)-p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}{1-yz}g(y)\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\xi_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{p_{n}(y)g(y)}{1-yz}\, dy\]

\end_inset 

 The goal is to show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 are easily evaluated, while also showing that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 are arbitrarily small.
 The first is easy enough: using equations 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:r_n definition}

\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:r_n series}

\end_inset 

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}c_{k}b_{k}\]

\end_inset 

 With a suitable choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are presumably easy to evaluate.
 To show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 is really a series acceleration for the geometric series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: geo series}

\end_inset 

, one must show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\xi_{n}(z)\right|$
\end_inset 

 is bounded.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)\ge0$
\end_inset 

, then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\xi_{n}(z)\right|\le\left|\frac{p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\right|\left|S(z)\right|\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset 

 is the point on the unit interval where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)$
\end_inset 

 assumes its maximum.
 Provided that one can find a polynomial sequence such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)}{p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}\right|\sim A^{-n}\]

\end_inset 

 for some number 
\begin_inset Formula $A>\left|1/z\right|$
\end_inset 

, then one has that the series 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $S(z)$
\end_inset 

 more rapidly than the simple partial sums 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=0}^{n}z^{k}b_{k}$
\end_inset 

 of equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq: geo series}

\end_inset

Note that the above is a proof of a series acceleration method for a more-or-les
s general sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

, and is in no way particular to the polylogarithm or the Hurwitz zeta.
 The only ingredients of the proof were that the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

well-behaved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 -- in this case, being expressible as moments of a rather general function
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

.
 For the proof to hold, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 needs to be (mostly) positive, and integrable; it need not be analytic,
 differentiable or even continuous.
 It needs to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

mostly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 positive only so that the bound on the integrand, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)g(y)\le\left|p_{n}\left(y_{0}\right)\right|g(y)$
\end_inset 

 can be established.
 Thus, one might hope that the acceleration method might work, even for
 those general cases where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(y)$
\end_inset 

 is not explicitly known, but the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset 

 are somehow

The Gaussian Distribution 
\layout Standard

Returning to the polylogarithm, the task at hand is to find a polynomial
 sequence that is suitable for establishing a tight bound on the error term
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

.
 A good bound minimizes the integrand, while also maximizing the value of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{n}(1/z)\right|$
\end_inset 

.
 In order to suppress the logarithmic branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset 

 in the integrand of 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, this section will consider the polynomial sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(y)=y^{a}(1-y)^{n-a}$
\end_inset 

, a sequence which goes over to the Gaussian distribution for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

Consider first the polynomial sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2n}(y)=y^{n}(1-y)^{n}$
\end_inset 

.
 It becomes sharply peaked at 
\begin_inset Formula $y=1/2$
\end_inset 

, and subtends a diminishingly small area.
 For large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, this polynomial sequence approximates a Gaussian:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p_{2n}(y)=\frac{1}{4^{n}}e^{-4n(y-1/2)^{2}}\left[1+2\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\mathcal{O}\left(\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{4}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Using this in the integral 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, and assuming that the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is not positive, it is not hard to deduce the very crude estimate
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\xi(s,z)\sim\left(\frac{z^{2}}{4(z-1)}\right)^{n}\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which confirms that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 does indeed get suitably small for a certain region in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 However, in order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Polylog general estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

.
 This bound is derived in the next section.
 
\layout Standard

The polynomial coefficients are easily obtained, and are 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
a_{0} & = & a_{1}=\cdots=a_{n-1}=0\\
a_{n+k} & = & \left(-1\right)^{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right)\quad\mbox{ for }0\le k\le n\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 This leads to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=-\frac{z^{2n+1}}{\left(z-1\right)^{n}}\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1}\frac{c_{k}}{\left(k+1\right)^{s}}+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset 

 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c_{k}=z^{k}\left[-\left(\frac{z-1}{z^{2}}\right)^{n}+\frac{1}{z^{n}}\sum_{j=0}^{k-n}\left(-1\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)\frac{1}{z^{j}}\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the summation above is to be understood to be zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset 

.
 The above summations can be re-organized into the more suggestive form
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;+\frac{1}{\left(1-z\right)^{n}}\;\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n}\frac{z^{k}}{k^{s}}\;\sum_{j=0}^{2n-k}\left(-z\right)^{j}\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)+\xi(s,z)\label{eq:polylog specific estimate}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 The error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(s,z)$
\end_inset 

 is negligible for only a very specific area of the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 The region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 may be ignored as a small error is derived in the next section.
 Substituting

 in the above formulas agrees with expressions previously given by Borwein

Bound on the Error Term
\layout Standard

In order for equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 to be useful computationally, an upper bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 needs to be given.
 To compute the polylogarithm to some desired precision, one infers a suitable
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 based on this bound.
 However, to achieve this desired precision, one must not only choose 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 large enough, but one must also maintain a somewhat larger number of digits
 in the intermediate terms, as the appearance of the binomial coefficient
 in the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 implies that intermediate terms can become quite large, even while mostly
 cancelling.
 This section derives an upper bound on the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset 

, and briefly discusses the issue of the required precision in intermediate
 terms.
 
\layout Standard

The general behavior of the integrand appearing in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

 depends on the whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\ge1$
\end_inset 

 or not; estimates are presented for these two cases.
 Writing 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 for real 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, and assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge1$
\end_inset 

 and choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$
\end_inset 

, one has
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\label{eq:}\\
 & = & \left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\left(y(1-y)\right)^{n-\sigma+1}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset 

 Each part of the right hand side is bounded by a Gaussian, and since the
 product of Gaussians is a Gaussian, so is the entire expression.
 From the Stirling approximation, one has the well-known identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(y(1-y)\right)^{a}\le\frac{1}{4^{a}}\exp-4a\left(y-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}\]

\end_inset 

 The other part is also bounded by a Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|y(1-y)\log y\right|^{a}\le\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{a}\exp\left(-\frac{a\left(y-y_{0}\right)^{2}}{2y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which is centered on the maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|$
\end_inset 

, that is, at 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}=0.23561058253\ldots$
\end_inset 

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{0}$
\end_inset 

 is the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\frac{d}{dy}\; y(1-y)\left|\log y\right|\]

\end_inset 

 Curiously, the numerical value of the factor in the Gaussian is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=4.013295587\ldots$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To evaluate the integral in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:xi integral}

\end_inset 

, one also needs a bound on the denominator.
 This is furnished by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{1}{1-yz}\right|\le C(z)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }\Re z\le0\\
\frac{1}{\left|1-z\right|} & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|<1\\
\left|\frac{z}{\Im z}\right| & \mbox{ if }0<\Re z\;\mbox{ and }\left|z\right|>1\end{cases}\]

\end_inset 

 Thus, the integrand is bounded by a Gaussian.
 Multiplying the two Gaussians, completing the square, and evaluating the
 resulting integral is a bit tedious.
 The result is that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|^{\sigma-1}}{4^{n}}\, G(s)\]

\end_inset 

 The constant may be taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|4y_{0}\left(1-y_{0}\right)\log y_{0}\right|=1.041381965\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $G(s)$
\end_inset 

 is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
G(s) & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\left(\sigma-1\right)\frac{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)}{8y_{0}\left(1-2y_{0}\right)+\frac{\sigma-1}{n-\sigma+1}}\\
 & \le & \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4n}}\exp-\left(1-2y_{0}\right)^{2}\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}\\
 & \le & 1\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\sigma$
\end_inset 

.
 Useful for estimation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $8y_{0}(1-2y_{0})=0.996687115\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 Combining these results, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|C(z)G(s)\left(1.0414\ldots\right)^{\sigma-1}\label{eq:error-bound-positive}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\sigma$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 chosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le n$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 may be evaluated as follows.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left|p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}\right| & \le & p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{\sigma-1}\\
 & = & \left|\frac{1-y}{\log y}\right|^{1-\sigma}y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\\
 & \le & y^{n}(1-y)^{n+\sigma-1}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 The integrand may now be recognized as the Beta function, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\int_{0}^{1}\,\frac{p_{2n}(y)\left|\log y\right|^{s-1}}{1-yz}\, dy\right|\le C(z)\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\]

\end_inset 

 In the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one may approximate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(n+\sigma)}{\Gamma(2n+\sigma+1)}\le\frac{2^{1-\sigma}}{4^{n}}\]

\end_inset 

 Combining the various pieces, one obtains a result remarkably similar to
 the previous one; namely, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\le1$
\end_inset 

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|\ll n$
\end_inset 

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left|\xi(s,z)\right|\le\frac{1}{4^{n}}\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|^{n}\left|\frac{z}{\Gamma(s)}\right|2^{1-\sigma}C(z)\label{eq:error-bound-negative}\end{equation}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

For evaluations on the critical line 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset 

, one needs a good estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

, which can become quite large as the imaginary part of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 increases.
 A useful estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 is given by Borwein 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bor00-A,Bor95}

\end_inset 

, for the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ge-m+1/2$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(s)\right|} & = & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\sigma+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\\
 & \le & \frac{1}{\left|\Gamma(\sigma)\right|}\sqrt{\frac{\sinh\tau\pi}{\tau\pi}\,\prod_{k=0}^{m}\left(1+\frac{\tau^{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}+k\right)^{2}}\right)}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

A remarkable side-effect of the estimation is that, for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 equal to negative integers, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(s)$
\end_inset 

 is infinite, thus implying that the error term is zero.
 This somewhat surprising result corresponds to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)$
\end_inset 

 has an exact expression as a ratio of two polynomials, the denominator
 being of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset 

.
 Indeed, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset 

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 gives the exact result 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{0}(z)=\frac{z}{1-z}\]

\end_inset 

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset 

, one must use 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset 

, to obtain the exact result
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-1}(z)=\frac{z}{\left(1-z\right)^{2}}\]

\end_inset 

 The generic form for the polylogarithm at the negative integers is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{-n}(z)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\,\sum_{k=0}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{k}\frac{k!}{\left(1-z\right)^{k+1}}\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n+1\\
k+1\end{array}\right\} \]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
n\\
k\end{array}\right\} $
\end_inset 

 denotes the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
\layout Standard

In general, the formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 seems to have the curious property of always evaluating to exactly the
 same rational function whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is a non-positive integer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $-s<n$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, for fixed non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, the sum is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 is large enough.
 Thus, this polynomial approximation has the pleasing result of giving exact
 answers in the case when an exact polynomial answer is possible.
\layout Standard

For the general case, one may conclude that the estimate 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 can be effectively applied whenever
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\frac{z^{2}}{z-1}\right|<4\]

\end_inset 

 To obtain a value of the polylogarithm to within some given numerical precision
, one must invert the formulas 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-positive}

\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-negative}

\end_inset 

, solving for the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 which is to be used in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

.
 To obtain a fixed number of digits of precision, one must carry out intermediat
e calculations with at least that many digits of precision.
 In fact, one must have more.
 The appearance of the binomial coefficient in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 is the problem.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}>\left(\begin{array}{c}
n\\
j\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset 

, one concludes that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 additional binary bits of precision are needed with which to carry out
 the calculations.
 As a result, it becomes difficult to implement the algorithm robustly using
 only double-precision arithmetic.
 For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, the algorithm is well-enough behaved; however, round-off errors significantly
 disturb the calculations as 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset 

.
 This trouble with precision can be at least partly alleviated by making
 use of the duplication formula, as discussed in the next section.

 to the indicated number of decimal places of precision.
 The values choosen for evaluation are

 for such a small value (

The primary contribution to the calculation of the either value is the evaluatio

 If these are precomputed, the Borwein algorithm still wins, as shown in
 the next figure.
 All calculations were performed on a contemporary desktop computer, using

 Note that the actual performance depends on the underlying implementation

 For such a small value of

 In this case, it is recognized that if 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is assumed to be held fixed, then the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 appearing in the Borwein algorithm may be precomputed.
 Similarly, the values of

\end_inset 

 and the binomial coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}

\end_inset 

 appearing in the Taylor's series may be precomputed.
 In this case, the Taylor's series evaluation appears to be about eight

Performing the precomputations can be terribly expensive.
 For example, for 300 decimal places of pecision, the precomputations take
 13 minutes.
 The break-even point, where both algorithms are equally fast at fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, when including the pre-computation overhead, occurs at about 600 evaluations
 of 300 decimal places.
 Unless one is making a very large number of evaluations at fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, the precomputation needed for the Taylor's expansion becomes prohibitively
 expensive as the number of desired decimal places goes up.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The first figure shows 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cold cache
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 performance, measured in seconds, as compared to the number of desired
 decimal places of precision.
 The figure is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cold cache
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, in recognition of the fact that some constants may be pre-computed.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is held fixed, while 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is varied, then the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 appearing in both the direct sum and the Borwein algorithm may be computed
 once, and then re-used for subsequent calculations.
 As the figures indicate, computing 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 can be very expensive for general complex-valued 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, and so the caching strategy offers a big gain when 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is held constant.
 
\layout Standard

As the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

cold cache
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 figure demonstrates, the Borwein algorithm is faster than direct summation.
 The problem with direct summation is that it requires more values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 to be computed to acheive comparable precision.
 
\layout Standard

As the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

warm cache
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 figure shows, the Borwein algorithm will still win against direct summation,
 even when the values of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-s}$
\end_inset 

 are pre-computed.
 Even when these are pre-computed, and can be pulled from the cache, direct
 summation still reqires more operations.
\layout Standard

A different but equally dramatic set of results obtain, when one compares
 the performance of the Borwein algorithm applied to the Hurwitz zeta function,
 as compared to the use of the Taylor's expansion 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz taylor}

\end_inset 

 for the Hurwitz zeta.
 In this case, as the figures show, the Taylor's series outperforms the
 Borwein algorithm by a constant factor of three, when both algorithms use
 precomputed constants.
 However, the cost of precomputing these constants skyrockets for the Taylor's
 series, making it unattractive as the number of required decimal places
 increases.
\layout Section

Duplication formula
\layout Standard

The region of applicability of the algorithm may be extended by making use
 of the duplication formula for the polylogarithm or periodic zeta.
 The duplication formula, or more generally, the multiplication theorem,
 is an extension of the well-known Legendre duplication formula for the
 Gamma function
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[(6.1.18),(6.3.8)(23.1.10)]{A&S}

\end_inset 

, into the domain of the polylogarithm.
\layout Standard

Thus, for example, the formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog specific estimate}

\end_inset 

 together with the error bounds 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-positive}

\end_inset 

,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:error-bound-negative}

\end_inset 

 allow 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q;s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

 to be computed for real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 in region 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4\le q\le3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 To obtain values on the region 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<1/4$
\end_inset 

, one applies the duplication formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(q;s\right)=2^{1-s}F\left(2q;s\right)-F\left(q+\frac{1}{2};s\right)\]

\end_inset 

 recursively until one obtains values of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\ge1/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Rearranging terms, one obtains a similar formula for iterating values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>3/4$
\end_inset 

 until they are less than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $3/4$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 approaches 0 or 1, the algorithm requires more time, but only logarithmically
 so, as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}q$
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}(1-q)$
\end_inset 

 as the case may be.
\layout Standard

The duplication formula follows from a general 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic identity 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}F\left(\frac{m+q}{p};s\right)=p^{1-s}F\left(q;s\right)\]

\end_inset 

 which is valid for any positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

.
 This formula may be obtained by noting that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(s;q\right)$
\end_inset 

 is an eigenvalue of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic Bernoulli transfer operator associated with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{1-s}$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ve-B04}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The equivalent formulas
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[Sections 7.3.1, 7.12.1]{Lew81}

\end_inset 

 for the polylogarithm are 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Li}_{s}(z)+\mbox{Li}_{s}(-z)=2^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{2}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset 

-adic version has the appearance of a Gauss sum:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(ze^{2\pi im/p}\right)=p^{1-s}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z^{p}\right)\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The application of the duplication formula, together with the inversion
 relation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:poly-hur relation}

\end_inset 

 can be used to extend the evaluation of the polylogarithm to the entire
 complex plane.
 For numerical work, both formulas must be applied, one alone is not enough.
 Consider first the application of the duplication formula only.
 It may be used to take points that are near to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, and map them further away from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, into the convergent region for the Borwein polynomial.
 Repeated application allows arbitrarily close approach to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 from the left-hand side.
 The resulting region of convergence is kidney-shaped, with the cusp of
 the kidney at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, and the kidney containing the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 The precise shape of the kidney depends on the number of terms one wishes
 to use in the polynomial approximation, the shape that can be acheived
 while still maintaining good running time is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Polylogarithm-phase-plot}

\end_inset 

.
 However, as can be seen, this strategy barely penetrates the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

 region.
\layout Standard

To extend the algorithm to the entire complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, one must make use of the Jonquière's inversion formula
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[pp 27-32]{Bate53}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
e^{-i\pi s/2}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)+e^{i\pi s/2}\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)=\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{\log z}{2\pi i}\right)\label{eq:Inversion formula}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 together with some sort of independent means of evaluating the Hurwitz
 zeta function.
 The Taylor expansion 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz taylor}

\end_inset 

 is particularly well-suited, as it is rapidly convergent in the vicinity
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Specifically, it is convergent when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\log z\right|<2\pi$
\end_inset 

, although the region of acceptable numerical convergence is smaller, roughly
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\log z\right|<\pi$
\end_inset 

.
 Either way, this encompasses a rather large region in the vicinity of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, which is exactly the region where the Borwein algorithm has trouble.
 The inversion formula is used to move points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|>1$
\end_inset 

 outside of the unit circle, to the inside.
 Not all points inside the unit circle are directly accessible to the Borwein
 algorithm; the duplication formula must still be used to handle points
 in the disk interior that are near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Similarly, points with very large 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

, such as those for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|>e^{2\pi}$
\end_inset 

, require the use of the duplication formula to be moved into the region
 of convergence for the Hurwitz Taylor series.
 A typical view of the polylogarithm on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane is shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Polylog-whole-plane}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

As a practical computational matter, rather than using 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Inversion formula}

\end_inset 

, it seems to be more convenient to use the formula
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{1-s}\left(z\right)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}\left[e^{i\pi s/2}\zeta\left(s,\frac{\log z}{2\pi i}\right)+e^{-i\pi s/2}\zeta\left(s,1-\frac{\log z}{2\pi i}\right)\right]\label{eq:polylog as pure hurwitz}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Although this is equivalent to the equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Inversion formula}

\end_inset 

 immediately above, it correctly captures the apropriate branch of the logarithm
 that should be used: equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog as pure hurwitz}

\end_inset 

 works well for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 in both the upper and lower half-planes, whereas equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Inversion formula}

\end_inset 

 is more difficult to correctly evaluate in the lower half 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

-plane.
 In either case, one must use the logarithm with an unusual branch cut,
 taking it to run from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 to the right along the positive real axis, as opposed to the usual cut
 taken for the logarithm.
 
\layout Standard

It is of some curiosity to note that the sheet that is forced takes the
 form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(s,q\right)+e^{-i\pi s}\zeta\left(s,1-q\right)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\]

\end_inset 

 A discussion of the monodromy follows.
\layout Section

Branch Points and Monodromy
\layout Standard

The principal sheet of the polylogarithm has a branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, and by convention, a branch cut is placed along the positive real 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-axis, extending to the right.
 As one moves off of the principal sheet, one discovers that there is another
 branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

 XXXX.
 The author is not aware of any simple published discussion of the monodromy
 for the polylogarithm; a much more abstract discussion is given in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Hain91}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Bloch91}

\end_inset 

.
 Thus, this section provides a discussion; the correct manipulations to
 move from one sheet to another can be somewhat trecherous and confusing.
 
\layout Standard

The inversion formula 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Inversion formula}

\end_inset 

 suggests a way to move around the branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Suppose one starts at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x+i\epsilon$
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 real, positive, and greater than one, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset 

 some arbitrarily small postive real number; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is very near the branch cut of the principal sheet.
 One wishes to compare this to the straddling value at 
\begin_inset Formula $x-i\epsilon$
\end_inset 

.
 Applying the inversion formula, one can bounce these two points inside
 the unit circle, where there is no cut, and thus the polylog differs by
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$
\end_inset 

.
 The difference accross the cut is thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(x+i\epsilon\right)-\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(x-i\epsilon\right)=e^{i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left[\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{\ln x+i\epsilon}{2\pi i}\right)-\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{\ln x-i\epsilon}{2\pi i}\right)\right]+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\]

\end_inset 

 Now, since 
\begin_inset Formula $x>1$
\end_inset 

, a naive application of this formula yeilds 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=0$
\end_inset 

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(x+i\epsilon)-\log(x-i\epsilon)=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$
\end_inset 

; but clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset 

 cannot be zero.
 To resolve this situation, one must make the Ansatz that the cut of the
 logarithm should be crossed.
 This may be done by taking the cut of the logarithm to extend to the right,
 instead of to the left, as it is by convention.
 One then gets 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(x+i\epsilon)-\log(x-i\epsilon)=2\pi iN+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$
\end_inset 

 for some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

.
 The difference across the cut, for positive 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(s,q\right)-\zeta\left(s,N+q\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{1}{\left(k+q\right)^{s}}\]

\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\ln(x)/2\pi i$
\end_inset 

.
 By swinging the cut of the logarithm so that it extends to the right, one
 obtains that the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 is positive; the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 runs between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset 

.
 As a result, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k+q\right)^{s}$
\end_inset 

 is unambiguous; as otherwise taking something to the power 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 also begs the question of which sheet the power must be taken on.
 That is, for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset 

, the power function is multi-sheeted:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
w^{s}=e^{s\ln w}\to e^{s(\ln w+2\pi iM)}=e^{2\pi isM}w^{s}\label{eq:M-sheet}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset 

 representing the sheet of the power function.
 Since the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 is taken as positive, one can temporarily operate with the assumption that
 
\begin_inset Formula $M=0$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Taking 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset 

, the above reasoning provides an excellent description, which may be verified
 numerically.
 The concentric semi-circles visible in the image 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Polylog-whole-plane}

\end_inset 

 can be entirely explained by the behaviour of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{s}$
\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

, that is, as 
\begin_inset Formula $z\to1$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, the difference between the 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset 

 sheet and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset 

 sheet is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta_{1}=e^{i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left(\frac{\ln z}{2\pi i}\right)^{s-1}\label{eq: N=+1 monodromy}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Properly speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset 

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

, and so one should write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{1}(s;z)$
\end_inset 

 to signify this.
 However, for ease of notation, this marking is dropped, and is taken implicitly
 in what follows.
 The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset 

 is illustrated in figure
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:N=+1 Upper-sheet}

\end_inset 

; the concentric rings are seen to be cancelled out precisely, leaving behind
 a smoothly varying function, having the expected smooth structure.
 Moving across the cut, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

, the joint appears to be smooth.
 For general positive 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, it is easy to confirm numerically that the discontinuity between the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

'th sheet, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset 

'th sheet, across the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

 cut is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta_{N}=e^{i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left(N-1+\frac{\ln z}{2\pi i}\right)^{s-1}\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The discontinuity across the cut 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

, for negative 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, follows similarly.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=-1$
\end_inset 

, the difference is given by -
\begin_inset Formula $1/(-1+q)^{1-s}=e^{-i\pi s}/(1-q)^{1-s}$
\end_inset 

, or 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta_{-1}=e^{-i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left(1-\frac{\ln z}{2\pi i}\right)^{s-1}\]

\end_inset 

 The figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:N=-1 Lower-sheet}

\end_inset 

 illustrates the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{-1}$
\end_inset 

.
 For general negative 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset 

, the difference between adjacent sheets is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta_{-N}=e^{-i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left(N-q\right)^{s-1}\]

\end_inset 

 Again, it can be numerically verified that that the transition from sheet
 to sheet is smooth as one crosses the cut 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

It is perhaps more clear to use explicit topological language.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

 represent the homotopy class of all loops based at some point 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 on the complex plane, that wind once around the branch-point 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 in the positive direction.
 The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

 on the polylogarithm has the effect of carrying the polylog from one sheet
 to the next.
 In the above discussion, it was determined that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{1}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{1}\]

\end_inset 

 The logarithm in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset 

 has a branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, after acting with 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

, one is now on a sheet with a cut extending from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 to the right.
 Let let 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}$
\end_inset 

 represent the homotopy class of loops that wind once around the branch
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 in a right-handed fashion.
 Acting on the logarithm, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}\cdot\ln z=\ln z+2\pi i\]

\end_inset 

 Recalling the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\ln z/2\pi i$
\end_inset 

, one thus has 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}\cdot q=q+1$
\end_inset 

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}\cdot\Delta_{N}=\Delta_{N+1}\]

\end_inset 

The principal sheet of the polylogarithm has no branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

, and so one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Similarly, the logarithm has no branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{1}\cdot\ln z=\ln z\]

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Consider now the task of pasting sheets together, such that the result is
 continuous as one crosses the cut 
\begin_inset Formula $z>1$
\end_inset 

.
 Some confusion may result here: one must paste together the cut of the
 polylog, and (if any), the cut of the logarithm as well.
 Thus, for example, suppose one is on the 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 sheet.
 To get to a sheet by means of a continuous, differentiable glueing across
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $z>1$
\end_inset 

 cut, one must move as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{1}g_{0}g_{1}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=g_{1}g_{0}\cdot\left[\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{1}\right]=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{1}-\Delta_{2}\]

\end_inset 

 Repeating this gluing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

 times, so that each time, one pastes the sheets so that crossing the 
\begin_inset Formula $z>1$
\end_inset 

 cut is smooth and differentiable, gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\left(g_{1}g_{0}\right)^{n-1}g_{1}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right) & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\sum_{k=1}^{n}\Delta_{k}\\
 & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-e^{i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\left(k-1+q\right)^{1-s}}\\
 & = & \mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-e^{i\pi s/2}\frac{\left(2\pi\right)^{s}}{\Gamma(s)}\left[\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{\ln z}{2\pi i}\right)-\zeta\left(1-s,n+\frac{\ln z}{2\pi i}\right)\right]\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset 

 which is recognizable from the initial considerations.
 
\layout Standard

Winding in the opposite direction, one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{1}^{-1}\cdot\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)-\Delta_{-1}\]

\end_inset 

 and to repeat this process, as above, one considers the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(g_{1}^{-1}g_{0}^{-1}\right)^{n}g_{1}^{-1}$
\end_inset 

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

In the development above, in the joining of sheets across 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re z>1$
\end_inset 

, the cut that runs between 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 was mostly ignored.
 Visually, the cut can be clearly seen in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:N=-1 Lower-sheet}

\end_inset 

.
 Consider now the task of glueing sheets across this cut.
 For a point 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 just above the line connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\epsilon+iv$
\end_inset 

 for some small, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset 

 and some general, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset 

.
 Just below this line, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1-\epsilon+iv$
\end_inset 

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 differs by 1, of course.
 This cut cannot be glued to the polylog, of course; it must be glued to
 another sheet of the logarithm.
 The correct gluing, for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x$
\end_inset 

 real, 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x<1$
\end_inset 

, is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\left[\Delta_{1}(x+i\epsilon)+e^{i2\pi s}\Delta_{-1}(x-i\epsilon)\right]=0\]

\end_inset 

 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}\cdot\Delta_{-1}=-e^{-i2\pi s}\Delta_{1}\]

\end_inset 

 This somewhat strange form is nothing more than an accounting trick; it
 is the result of providing a definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{-N}$
\end_inset 

 that had a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 normalization, avoiding a minus sign.
 The price of that definition is this glitch.
 In all other respects, the homotpy proceeds as expected, so that, for example,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}\cdot\Delta_{-N}=\Delta_{-N+1}\]

\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

The free combinations of powers of the two operators 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

 generate a group, the monodromy group of the polylogarithm.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $s=m$
\end_inset 

 a positive integer, the monodromy group has a finite-dimensional representation
 of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $m+1$
\end_inset 

.
 Well-known is the case for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset 

, where the representation forms the discrete Heisenberg group.
 This may be seen as follows.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2,$
\end_inset 

 one has 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta_{n}=2\pi i\left(\ln z+(n-1)2\pi i\right)\]

\end_inset 

 Repeated applications of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

 result in a linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{2}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln z$
\end_inset 

 and 1; no terms of any other type appear.
 One may take these three elements as the basis of a three-dimensional vector
 space.
 Writing the basis as a column vector,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mbox{Li}_{2}\left(z\right)\\
-2\pi i\ln z\\
4\pi^{2}\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 one then has the action 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{0}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]\quad\mbox{ and }\quad g_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 which may be seen to be the generators of the discrete Heisenberg group
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{3}(\mathbb{Z})$
\end_inset 

.
 The general group element is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & a & b\\
0 & 1 & c\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c$
\end_inset 

.
 By convention, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{0}$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset 

, and defines 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 as the commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $z=xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$
\end_inset 

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset 

 The element 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

 is in the center, so that it commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset 

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $zx=xz$
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $zy=yz$
\end_inset 

.
 These relations may be taken as giving the group presentation, so that
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}_{3}(\mathbb{Z})=\left\{ (x,y):\; z=xyx^{-1}y^{-1},\; zx=xz,\; zx=xz\right\} \]

Validation

The correctness of a given numerical implementation can be validated in
 a number of ways.
 For non-positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, one has the exact rational functions previously mentioned.
 For positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset 

, one has the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)+\left(-1\right)^{n}\mbox{Li}_{n}\left(e^{-2\pi iq}\right)=-\frac{\left(2\pi i\right)^{n}}{n!}B_{n}(q)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}(x)$
\end_inset 

 are the Bernoulli polynomials.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, one regains the Riemann zeta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(-1\right)=\frac{1}{2^{1-s}-1}\,\zeta(s)\label{eq:}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

, the defining series 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:polylog definition}

 is explicitly convergent, and may be directly summed, thus offering a fourth

 Finally, the multiplication theorem can be used to check for consistency.

The

\end_inset 

Periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Zeta Function
\layout Standard

The ability to compute the polylogarithm allows one to visualize some of
 the interesting sums that occur in number theory.
 One such example is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, defined by Apostol
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[Thm 12.6]{Apo76}

\end_inset 

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(q;s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i2\pi nq}}{n^{s}}\label{eq:periodic zeta}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 Clearly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)$
\end_inset 

.
 The periodic zeta function occurs when one attempts to state a reflection
 formula for the Hurwitz zeta function, as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\zeta(1-s,q)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\left[e^{-i\pi s/2}F(q;s)+e^{i\pi s/2}F(1-q;s)\right]\label{eq:Hurwitz reflection}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 What makes the periodic zeta function interesting is that 
\emph on 
it is not actually periodic
\emph default 
.
 That one might think it is seems obvious from the definition 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:periodic zeta}

\end_inset 

: the direct substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

 gives the false suggestion of periodicity in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 This is false because, in fact, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 has a branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is multi-sheeted, and, attempting to trace a continuous path
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to q+1$
\end_inset 

, while keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 real carries one through the branch-point, and from one sheet to the next.
 This may be illustrated in several ways; first, graphically, in figures

This graph shows the real and imaginary parts of the periodic zeta function
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(q,s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25$
\end_inset 

.
 This value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is close to a zero of the Riemann zeta function, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i25.01085758014\ldots$
\end_inset 

 Thus, both the real and imaginary parts approach zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

, as well as at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

.
 The increasing oscillations as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 are due to the contribution of the very first term of the Hurwitz zeta:
 that is, these oscillations are nothing other than that of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{i25\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

.
 Subtracting these away is the same as analytically continuing to the region
 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

, and matches the coarser set of oscillations, which are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(1+q)^{-s}=e^{i25\log(1+q)}/\sqrt{1+q}$
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Noteworthy is that the presumed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodicity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 is very misleading: the image suggests an essential singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset 

, and continuing, logarithmically slower oscillatory behavior for the analytic
 continuation to the region where 
\begin_inset Formula $q>1$
\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

 
\layout Standard

The first figure, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, shows an oscillatory behavior that clearly diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

.
 This oscillation is can be simply explained.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i\tau$
\end_inset 

 into equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz reflection}

\end_inset 

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)=\frac{e^{-i\pi/4}e^{-i\tau\log2\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{2\cosh\tau\pi}}\left[e^{\pi\tau/2}F(q;s)+ie^{-\pi\tau/2}F(1-q;s)\right]\]

\end_inset 

 after the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}e^{i\phi}}{\sqrt{\cosh\tau\pi}}\]

\end_inset 

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset 

 is a purely real phase that can be expressed as a somewhat complicated
 sum
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite[eqn 6.1.27]{A&S}

\end_inset 

.
 For reasonably large, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=25$
\end_inset 

 in the picture, one may ignore the second term, so that the whole expression
 simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(q;\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)=\exp\, i\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\phi+\tau\log2\pi\right)\;\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}-i\tau,\, q\right)+\mathcal{O}\left(C^{-\tau}\right)\]

\end_inset 

 for some real constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C>0$
\end_inset 

.
 Then, as 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

, the leading contribution to the Hurwitz zeta comes from the 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset 

 term in equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hurwitz zeta}

\end_inset 

: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}=e^{i\tau\log q}/\sqrt{q}$
\end_inset 

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F\left(q;\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)\approx\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\;\mbox{ as }q\to0\label{eq:F-approx}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 for some fixed, real phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset 

 that is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 As is eminently clear from both the picture 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, and from the approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

, the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q,s)$
\end_inset 

 cannot be taken: this is the branch-point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset 

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Curiously, the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

 does exist, and one has 
\begin_inset Formula $F(1,s)=\zeta(s)$
\end_inset 

 the Riemann zeta.
 The approximation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 hints at how to move through the branch point, from one sheet to the next:
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset 

 is the discontinuity between sheets.
 That is, one has, for large, positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(q+1;\,\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)\approx F\left(q,\,\frac{1}{2}+i\tau\right)-\frac{e^{i\tau\log q}e^{i\psi}}{\sqrt{q}}\]

\end_inset 

 as the formula that approximates the movement from one sheet to the next.
 In essence, this shows that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 zeta function is not at all periodic: 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q+1;s)\ne F(q;s)$
\end_inset 

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\Re s\le1$
\end_inset 

.
 
\layout Standard

The complete relationship between the Hurwitz zeta and the periodic zeta
 is rather subtle.
 For example, if instead one considers large 
\emph on 
negative
\emph default 
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, and graphs the periodic zeta, one obtains what is essentially the left-right
 reversed image of 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Periodic-zeta-function}

\end_inset 

, with oscillations approaching a singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

.
 One may easily 
\emph on 
numerically
\emph default 
 verify that these oscillations are precisely of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-q)^{-s}$
\end_inset 

.
 From this, one may deduce that the correct form of the reflection formula
 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F(q,1-s)=\frac{\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi)^{s}}\left[e^{i\pi s/2}\zeta(s,q)+e^{-i\pi s/2}\zeta(s,1-q)\right]\label{eq:periodic reflection}\end{equation}

\end_inset 

 which captures the oscillatory behavior at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to0$
\end_inset 

 for large positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 and the oscillations at 
\begin_inset Formula $q\to1$
\end_inset 

 for large negative 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

.
 The precise form of the discontinuity across the branch point, that would
 be valid for small positive or negative 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, is not at all clear.

Conclusion
\layout Standard

The updated algorithm appears to offer a stable and fast way of computing
 the Hurwitz zeta function for general complex 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 and real 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

.
 It allows the polylogarithm to be computed over an extended range as well.
 An actual implementation using a variable-precision library shows that
 the algorithm is quite tractable.
 
\layout Standard

An unexplored area is the optimal implementation of the algorithm using
 standard IEEE double-precision floating-point mathematics.
 Preliminary work shows that some of the intermediate terms are just large
 enough so that rounding error may be of concern; the region of high-precision
 convergence has not been characterized.
 The propagation of rounding errors through the algorithm has not been character
ized; it may be possible to re-arrange terms to minimize the propagation
 of errors.
 Such a characterization is necessary before reliable double-precision code
 can be created.
 By contrast, such considerations can be swept under the carpet when employing
 arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

 a rapid, globally convergent algorithm for the Lerch transcendental, thus
 enabling a deeper numerical exploration of its peculiarities.

Another peculiar corner of of the theory of special functions is the characteriz
ation of the periodic zeta function.
 The discontinuity across the branch cut of the periodic zeta is unclear;
 it should be carefully characterized in relation to the branch cuts of
 the polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta.

This image illustrates the so-called

periodic zeta function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(q;s)=\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(e^{2\pi iq}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\exp(2i\pi nq)}{n^{s}}\]

\end_inset 

 Graphed is the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(q;s)$
\end_inset 

, with a color scale such that black represents zero, greenish-blue being
 values on the order of one, yellow on the order of two, with increasingly
 large values shown as orange-red.
 Along the horizontal axis runs 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

, taken to be real, from 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset 

 on the left to 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

 on the right.
 Then, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\frac{1}{2}+i\tau$
\end_inset 

, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is varied along the vertical axis, running from 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset 

 at the bottom of the image, to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=50$
\end_inset 

 at the top of the image.
 Zeroes of the Riemann zeta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(s)=F(1,s)$
\end_inset 

 are located where the blue lines intersect the right edge of the image.
 From the bottom, the first three zeroes are at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+i14.13,\,0.5+i20.02,\,0.5+i25.01$
\end_inset 

.
 Due to the relation to the Dirichlet eta function, the zeros also materialize
 at the same values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

, but on the 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1/2$
\end_inset 

 line.
\layout Standard

Remarkably, the blue streaks seem to be roughly parabolic, but are interrupted
 by nearly straight 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

erasures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The pattern is reminiscent of graphs of the strong-field Stark effect (need
 ref).
 In the Stark effect, eigenvalues are given by the characteristic values
 of the Mathieu functions.
 These cross over one another in a curious fashion; see for example, figure
 20.1 in Abramowitz & Stegun.
 
\layout Standard

The precise form of the parabolic blue streaks are due to a term of the
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{-s}$
\end_inset 

, as given by equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:F-approx}

\end_inset

 These may be subtracted, as illustrated in the next image.

This image shows the magnitude of

\end_inset 

 for the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le q\le1$

along the horizontal axis, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\tau\le50$
\end_inset 

 along the vertical axis, just as in the previous image; the same coloration
 scheme is used as well.
 This essentially corresponds to the previous picture, with the leading
 divergence subtracted; for large positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

, the magnitude of the periodic zeta and the Hurwitz zeta differ by an exponenti
ally small amount.
 A careful comparison of this picture to the previous now shows that the

Extended view of Hurwitz zeta

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows a view of the magnitude of the Hurwitz zeta 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta(s,q)\right|$
\end_inset 

 over an extended range, together with a rescaling of coordinates in an
 attempt to straighten out the striations.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset 

 ranges from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}\approx2.8$
\end_inset 

 along the horizontal axis, although it is scaled as 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{3/2}$
\end_inset 

 along this axis.
 This rescaling essentially turns the parabolic striations into straight,
 radial lines emanating from the origin at the lower left.
 This image also re-scales the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 coordinate, in an attempt to turn the radial striations into horizontals.
\layout Standard

The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1$
\end_inset 

 is a vertical line running exactly down the middle of the image; the non-trivia
l Riemann zeroes are visibly stacked up on this line.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 runs from 0 to 100 on this vertical line.
 On other verticals, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 has been rescaled by 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{1/2}$
\end_inset 

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 runs from 0 to 141 on the right hand side of the image, while being essentially
 held at zero along the left edge of the image.
\layout Standard

The increasing complexity of the chain-link pattern is apparent as one moves
 up the imaginary axis.
 Equally apparent is that the maximum range of excursion of the magnitude
 changes only slowly over the range of the image: as the pattern increases
 in complexity, it does not wash out, but has a distinct binary on/off character.

\layout Standard

This image shows a phase plot for the polylogarithm, on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+i80$
\end_inset 

.
 The color scheme is such that black represents the phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\arg\mbox{Li}_{s}\left(z\right)=-\pi$
\end_inset 

, red represents the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $+\pi$
\end_inset 

, and green a phase of zero.
 Points where the phase wraps around the full color range are zeros.
 Thus, each of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fingers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in this image terminates on a zero.
 Most of these zeros are close to, but usually not quite on the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The lone zero near the center of the image corresponds to the zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

.
 The slight cusp at the right side of the image corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 The outer boundary of the image, adjoining to the solid green area, represents
 the limit of convergence for the combination of the Borwein algorithm and
 the duplication formula; one can enlarge the region of convergence slightly,
 but not much, but using polynomial approximations of higher order.
 The image is offset somehat, rather than being centered on 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

, because most of the convergent region is to the left of the imaginary
 axis.
\layout Standard

Note the lone zero floating along inside of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<1$
\end_inset 

 disk.
 If this picture were animated as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 increased from 0 in the positive direction, then the zero fingers can be
 see be seen as marching across in a counter-clockwise fashion, starting
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

and proceeding around.
 Most zeros die out at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

 after making a full revolution; others spiral around a second time, such
 as the lone zero up top.

This image illustrates the results of combining the Borwein algorithm together
 with the inversion and duplication formulas.
 The image shows the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, is centered on 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0,$
\end_inset 

 and runs from -3.5 to +3.5, left to right, top to bottom.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+15i$
\end_inset 

 for the whole picture.
 The color scheme is the same as for the previous picture.
 
\layout Standard

Besides the zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset 

 at the center of the picture, another zero is visible to the left, and
 slightly down.
 This zero is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ex-Riemann zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, in that, if instead one had created the image for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+i14.1347\ldots$
\end_inset 

, then this point would have been located exactly at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

.
 As it happens, this point has now rotated to slightly below 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset

 The zeroes above and to the right of the origin are Riemann zeroes to be:
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$

Polylogarithm off the critical axis
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

This figure shows the polylogarithm in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset 

-plane, at fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau=1.2+i14$
\end_inset 

.
 It is superficially similar to the previous image, with two notable differences.
 Visibile just under the cut, on the right is a zero.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 were smaller, this zero would move to the left; at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.5$
\end_inset 

, it would be very near to the branch point at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 gets larger, this point moves up, crossing the branch cut and moving onto
 the next sheet.
 Of course, if instead one had 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma+i\tau=0.5+i14.13\ldots$
\end_inset 

, this zero would be located precisely at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

.
 Thus, this figure illustrates what a Riemann zero looks like when it is
 not on the critical strip.
\layout Standard

As 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 increases, the remaining zeroes circle around in a widening spiral: thus,
 the zero at the far left of the image is not near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-1$
\end_inset 

, but is to the left of there (and thus is not going to be a zero of the
 Dirichlet eta function).
 If instead one had 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 with a value of less than 0.5, the zeroes would spiral around in an ever-tighten
ing spiral, and would never hit the branch cut or cross over.
 The Riemann hypothesis is essentially that these zeroes are impacting exactly
 at the branch point; a violation of RH would be a pair of zeroes that failed
 to hit the branch point, instead passing to the left and right of the branch
 point.
 This figure suggests that RH holds: the zeroes are clearly lined up in
 single file; it is hard to imagine how this single file might break ranks
 into a pair of zeros that simultaneously passed near the branch point.

 Two zeroes are visible: one at

\begin_inset Quotes eld

ex-Riemann zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, located not far from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, a bit above the real axis.
 For this image, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset 

 is held constant, at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+i15$
\end_inset 

; the Riemann zeta function has its first non-trivial zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.5+i14.13\ldots$
\end_inset 

.
 At that value, the above zero would have been located precisely at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset 

, on the branch point of the polylogarithm.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 increases, the Riemann zeroes pass preciesely through this branch point,
 leaving the first sheet and moving to this.
 
\layout Standard

Indeed, the Riemann hypothesis can be taken as being equivalent to the statement
 that the Riemann zeroes always pass through the branch point in moving
 from one sheet to another.
 Taking 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset 

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset 

 is held constant at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma<1/2$
\end_inset 

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset 

 is increased, the polylogarithm zeroes never pass through thr branch cut,
 and stay on the main sheet; whereas for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>1/2$
\end_inset 

, they do pass through the branch cut, but not at the branch point.
