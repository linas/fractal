\begin_layout Abstract
Some simple examples of modeloids.
 T ahese are simple enough to be considered to be

homework problems

.
 The goal is to help me understand the concept.
 Examples include an abelian group and binary trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some worked examples of modeloids.
 Based on Benda's paper from 1979.
 All text refers to definitions there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Equality on five objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a set 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left\{ a,b,c,d,e\right\} $
\end_inset

 with five objects.
 The goal is to model equality on this set.
 Thus, the structure is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ =\right\} $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $=$
\end_inset

 a binary relation, equality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 consists of 5 strings of length one, 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times5=20$
\end_inset

 strings of length two, 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times4\times3=60$
\end_inset

 strings of length three, 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times4\times3\times2=120$
\end_inset

 of length four and 120 of length five.
 So a total 325 strings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are five relations: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a=a,b=b,c=c,d=d,e=e\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following example 1.5, we look for functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:A\to A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x=y$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $fx=fy$
\end_inset

.
 These will have to be 1-to-1 and onto.
 Any permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 will do, and so there are 120 such functions.
 Picking any one of these gives a modeloid 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and so we conclude there are 120 distinct modeloids for this object.
 Extending 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 to all of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is trivial; consideration of strings of length two or more add nothing
 new.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude the modeloid corresponds to the permutations on five objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per definition of derivatives, this has complexity 0, and is thus a basic
 modeloid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Module addition on five objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Same as above, but using the structure 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ =,+\right\} $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 interpreted as affine modulo addition.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

affine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 just means there is no zero object.
 Example 1.5 asks us to convert addition to a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 which is true when 
\begin_inset Formula $x+y=z$
\end_inset

.
 For this case, assume 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 is a total function.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, any set of sequential integers will do.
 Any set of sequetial even numbers will also work.
 Multiples of 3, etc.
 May as well use 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left\{ 0,1,2,3,4\right\} $
\end_inset

 without loss of generality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 now drops to five.
 For all five, must have 
\begin_inset Formula $f0=0$
\end_inset

.
 Other than this, 
\begin_inset Formula $f1$
\end_inset

 can be anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Appearently, we are forced into this, without having to add constants 0
 or 1 to the structure.
 Modulo addition always has some element that must behave like 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extending 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 to strings in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 brings nothing new.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude the modeliod corresponds to the Abelian group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, this is a basic modeloid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Binary Trees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to model binary trees.
 There are two distinct versions: all finite trees, and the infinite binary
 tree aka the Cantor set.
 The set of finite binary trees coresponds to the set of finite binary strings.
 A single inequality 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 suffices, if we take it to mean that the shorter string matches the leading
 substring of the longer string.
 There are no functions in this structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While reading Benda, multiple conceptual or theoretical issues arise.
 So, below is a collection of open, unresolved questions (for me).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Countability - In section 0.
 Preliminaries, he seems to assume the set 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is finite.
 But the intersting objects are integers, reals, the Cantor set, etc.
 These are countable or uncountable.
 How will this work out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Partial
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

relations - In example 1.5, we are asked to convert functions to relations.
 Should we assume that these are only the true relations, or true and also
 false? For example, on a partial order, the order relation is not total.
 So I guess the answer is no.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Least
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

modeloid At the start of the section on modeloids, Benda talks as if there
 is only one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

least modeloid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But the above five examples have no unique single least.
