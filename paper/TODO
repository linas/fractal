New TODO List -- August 2012

* write up the geodesics on the funcamental domain trick.
* make corrections to all places that talk about the shift operator
  search for Wold decompoosition: emphasize differences not just
  similarities.  Try to get more rigorous.

* Make corrections to all uses of delta(x-y) for the Bernoulli thing,
  since it is dirac delta only when acting on polynomials, viz not
  the complete space (since sin() is in the completeion ofthe
  polynomials, and it is in the kernel.   Also, avoid use of teh word
  "orthogonal" when talking about things in a Banach space.

* Binary rotations are called the Thompson group:
  -- study up on group
  -- get good references for it
  -- update all discussions in all texts to talk about it.

Look for

G Levin On Mayer's conjecture and zeros of entire functions,
Ergod. Th. Dyn Sys, 14 (1994) pp 565-574

This shows that spectra of frob-perron operators need not be real,
might be complex.

the following shows that spectrum of gauss map is real:
