\begin_layout Title
Greatest Prime Factor

\begin_layout Abstract
There appears to be very little written about the greatest prime factor
 (gpf) function, and especially it's generating functions.
 This paper provides a numerical, visual survey of it's exponential generating
 function, illustrating its remarkable symmetry properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cursory search of the internet indicates that very little is known
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Weis-GPF"

\end_inset

 about the greatest prime factor function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{gpf}(n)$
\end_inset

 that returns the largest prime divisor of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Some values and addtitional references are given in the OEIS A006530
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "OEIS-6530"

\end_inset

.
 I was unable to find anything at all discussing the typical analytic formulatio
ns of this sequence, such as the ordinary generating function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(z\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)z^{n}
\]

\end_inset

or the exponential generating function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left(z\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)\frac{z^{n}}{n!}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, I thought I would do a bit of numerical exploration.
 The exponential generating function exhibits a variety of remarkable symmetric
 and fractal properties.
 On the one hand, this is perhaps not surprising, as fractal symmetries
 are common in number theory.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-M04,Vep-mink2008"

\end_inset

 On the other hand, the actual figures make it clear that this function
 is quite unlike anything else.
 This paper is a numerical and visual exploration of the exponential generating
 function, exposing it's patterns of self-similarities.
 It offers essentially no analytic results; despite the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 structure, obtaining exact results appears to be difficult.

\begin_layout Section*
Phase Plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Phase-of-OGF"

\end_inset

 is a phase plot of the ordinary generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 for complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 This function has a radius of convergence of one, with what appears to
 be essential singularities scattered all about the unit circle.
 The function is not obviously any kind of modular form, but is suggestive
 of some sort of theta function.
 That is, there is some vague fractal self-similarity-ish behavior, which
 is very typical of any sort of modular form or function;
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ve-Num05"

\end_inset

 however, its not in any "obvious" form that 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-function or the Eisenstein functions would have.
 On the other hand, it seems that just about any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sequence has a similar general appearance, and so there is not much intuitive
 information that can be extracted from this figure.

This figure shows the phase (arctan) of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

; that is, it shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp i\varphi\left(z\right)=G\left(z\right)/\left|G\left(z\right)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 The color coding is such that red indicates a phase of 
\begin_inset Formula $+\pi$
\end_inset

, green is a phase of zero, and black is a phase of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\pi$
\end_inset

.
 The sharp red-black transitions are where the phase wraps around by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 These transition lines can only terminate on zeros and on poles; which
 is which can be identified by whether the phase wraps counterclockwise
 or clockwise.
 Here, the lines that terminate inside the unit circle all terminate on
 zeros; the edge of the circle is ringed with both poles and zeros.
 The exterior of the unit circle is colored green: there is no analytic
 extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 outside of the unit circle.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the a phase plot of the exponential generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 on the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane.
 This function appears to be entire! The width of the figure is 120; that
 is, it graphs the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $-60\le x,y\le+60$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x+iy$
\end_inset

.
 The rays all appear to terminate on zeros of the function; there do not
 appear to be any poles anywhere (except at infinity, of course).
 But then, the absence of poles should be clear, as gpf is bounded: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)\le n$
\end_inset

 and so one would expect 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 to be bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{z}$
\end_inset

.

The red-black color transition in both figures

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Phase-of-EGF"

\end_inset

 indicates a location where the phase changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Such color transition lines can only ever terminate on poles and zeros.
 Since phases can only wrap counterclockwise around a zero, and clockwise
 around a pole, such transition lines can never connect two zeros; they
 can only connect a zero to a pole.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 has only zeros on the (finite) complex plane, the transition lines seen
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Phase-of-EGF"

\end_inset

 must neccessarily extend, more-or-less radially, out to infinity, where
 they meet an essential singularity.
 This simple effect explains most of the visual structure of this image.

The regularity of the thickness of these phase-fingers immediately provides
 a hypothesis about the zeros.
 The figure reveals that the zeros seem to be more or less uniformly distributed
 about the complex plane.
 In order for the fingers to remain of uniform width, this implies that
 the number of zeros within a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\left|z\right|$
\end_inset

 must be proportional to the circumference of the circle.
 Were this not the case, the fingers could not stay at a quasi-uniform width.
 Thus, visual evidence applied to Cauchy's argument principle suggests that
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N\left(r\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\left|z\right|=r}\frac{E^{\prime}\left(z\right)}{E\left(z\right)}dz=\mathcal{O}\left(r\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

 is the number of zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 within a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\left|z\right|$
\end_inset

.
 This is explored in greater detail in a later section, where the numerical
 evidence suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N\left(r\right)=r+\mathcal{O}\left(\log r\right)
\]

\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\to\infty$
\end_inset

 (or, at least, for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 that are several orders of magnitude larger).

\begin_layout Section*
Zeroes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Phase-of-EGF"

\end_inset

 suggests that the zeros are fairly uniformly distributed; however it is
 fairly cluttered, so it's hard to tell quite where they really are.
 If there is regularity, it is obscured.
 Thus, figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Zeros-of-E"

\end_inset

 is used to explicitly expose the location of zeros as black dots in the
 image.
 The figure shows the absolute value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|E\left(z\right)\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 diverges as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\left|z\right|}$
\end_inset

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

; thus the color scale is selected to show 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(z\right)e^{-\left|z\right|}$
\end_inset

to make the zeros more easily visible.

 That is, red corresponds to values of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.17\approx1/0.24$
\end_inset

 or greater, and green to values of about 2.
 The color scheme on the right exposes a clustering of the zeros that is
 less evident on the left.

The zeros in figure

 Perhaps one should zoom out.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This exposes a new and interesting feature: rays! Lanes that are free of
 any zeros! Rays for the cyclic groups 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$

  can be seen as well.
 There's a hint of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$
\end_inset

.
 Notably absent (or just hard to see?) are rays for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$

 This seems to lead to a natural conjecture that zeros only occur on rays

 prime.

 The big blue-black blobs in the left image are five different zeros, fairly

The above conjecture can be explored by taking slices along rays, shown
 in the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It shows six slices, taken along the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $z=e^{i\theta}$

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0,\pi,2\pi/3,2\pi/4,$

\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/5,2\pi/6$

.The leading divergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\left|z\right|}$
\end_inset

 has been removed, leaving a divergence that seems to be about of order
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|/\log\left|z\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Notable in this graph is that no zeros are visible along the rays for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=2\pi/4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=2\pi/6$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests the the above conjecture about rays at primes vs.
 composites was incorrect.

 It's visually clear that the wavelengths get longer as

A similar exploration of rays directed along quadratic irrationals suggests
 that such rays pass very close to zeros on a number of occasions, but none
 actually pass through a zero.

 The close passes are visible: keep in mind that since the leading exponential
 scaling is removed, the close passes visualized here are indeed very close.
 At any rate, the phase along a slice is not simple or regular; the figure
 is a mess.

Below is another table of zeros, this one for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{EG}\left(n\mbox{gpf};z\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)=n\cdot\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{EG}\left(f;z\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f\left(n\right)\frac{z^{n}}{n!}
\]

\end_inset

That is, this is the same gpf exponential series, except that it's been
 shifted over by one.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{EG}\left(n\mbox{gpf};z\right)=z\frac{d}{dz}E\left(z\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)\frac{z^{n}}{\left(n-1\right)!}
\]

\end_inset

Note that these are in the same general location as the above, except that
 they have moved inwards a bit.

Random Sequences

\begin_layout Standard
Before one gets too excited, its worth asking: how much of the general shape
 of this function is due to the fact that the greatest-prime-factor sequence
 is being used, and how much is "generic", shared by any similar series?
 To answer this question, one can generate random series 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{rs}\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

 that roughly resemble 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{gpf}\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Consider, first, the series having the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $2\le\mbox{rs}\left(n\right)\le n$
\end_inset

, but otherwise having a uniform distribution in this range.
 In such a case, one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{EG}\left(\mbox{rs};z\right)$
\end_inset

 does have zeros scattered all over the complex plane, in a roughly similar
 distribution; however, the rays are completely absent, as can be seen in
 figure

 Without a negative

The most notable aspect of this image, as compared to the earlier ones,
 is the narrowing of the rays.
 If one asked for the number of zeros in a pie-sliced wedge, and graphed
 that as a function of the angle, one would see a devil's-staircase type
 function.
 But, as this image shows, the treads on those stairs decrease in size as
 the radius of the circle increases.
 The rate is unclear; perhaps it goes as the square-root of the radius?
 That is, there are lanes that are completely free of zeros; these lanes
 get wider for larger radius, but at a sub-linear rate.
 They would have to, to make room for finite-width lanes for every rational!
 A formula for the lane-width is discovered in a later section, below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The widening of these zero-free lanes is one of the more interesting aspects
 of this image.
 Clearly, this image, more strongly than any other, suggests of a ray for
 every rational.
 The simplest rationals have the widest lanes; but what, exactly, constitutes
 "simplest", here? If the rays are arranged according to widths, do they
 come in Farey-fraction order? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notable is a vague hint or suggestion of Moire patterning along the
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis.
 Recall that Moire patterns occur when one regular (cyclic) grid pattern
 is superimposed on another, but shifted over.
 In this case, one regular pattern are the square pixels of the image; the
 other is the location of the zeros.
 The appearance of a Moire pattern is then strong evidence that the location
 of the zeros are not "random", but are correlated in some regular, cyclic
 way (as one moves from ray to ray).
 But of course it is: figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Slices-along-Rays"

\end_inset

 shows six slices taken along a constant angle (six rays).
 These each show a characteristic oscillation with some very strong Fourier
 components.
 The Moire patterns are these same Fourier components, interfering with
 the characteristic pixel size.

The asymptotic behavior of the generating function can be guessed at by
 numerical means.
 The graphs below show the re-scaled quantity <i>-7/4 + EG(gpf; r) exp(-r)
 log(r) / r</i> as a function of <i>√r</i>.
 The strong periodic oscillations are clearly visible.
 The rescaling hides just how small these oscillations are: So, for <i>√r
 = 60</i>, one has <i>r = 3600</i> and <i>r exp(r)/log(r) ~ 10<sup>1566</sup></i
>, and so the amplitude of the oscillations is 1566 orders of magnitude
 smaller than the function itself! OK, so the exponential divergence is
 obvious.
 What we have left is then <i>r /log(r) ~ 440</i> so we're pulling out two
 orders of magnitude.
 That this does indeed seem to be the correct asymptotic scaling is reinforced
 by the graph that shows the same oscillations out to <i>√r = 600</i>.
 This corresponds to <i>r = 360K</i> and <i>r /log(r) ~ 2.8 · 10<sup>4</sup></i>,
 which is large! That the oscillations are happening around 7/4 = 1.75 is
 just a suggestion from the graph: closer numerical work suggests that the
 centerline is perhaps at 1.744.

\begin_layout Section*
The Fourier Spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the Fourier spectrum? Low-frequency noise, it seems.
 The figure below shows the amplitude of the Fourier components, as a function
 of frequency.
 Specifically, this shows the amplitude <i>√(a²(ω)+b²(ω))</i> where the
 Fourier components are <br> <br> &emsp;&emsp;<i>a(ω) = ∫ f(t²) cos(2π ωt)
 dt</i> <br> <br> &emsp;&emsp;<i>b(ω) = ∫ f(t²) sin(2π ωt) dt</i> <br> <br>
 and where <i>f(r)</i> is the asymptotically rescaled generating function:
 <br> <br> &emsp;&emsp;<i>f(r) = -7/4 + EG(gpf; r) exp(-r) log(r) / r</i>
 <br> <br> The integration is taken over the range <i>10 &lt; t &lt; 610</i>.
 This corresponds to the second graph above.
 Again, its hard to overemphasize how small these oscillations are: the
 integral is performed over a region where the generating function blows
 up by 161 thousand orders of magnitude! Take some caution, however, in
 interpreting the graph scale: the amplitude at any given frequency is probably
 either zero or infinite; this graph is just an approximation to the true
 Fourier spectrum, which (I presume) consists of Dirac delta functions of
 various weights at various irrationals.
 <p> Perhaps the most notable feature of this graph is that, indeed, it
 looks very noisy: there is no obvious self-similar structure in it.
 Its hard to make out what the fall-off in frequency is: its perhaps cubic.
 In case you are wondering: no, this is NOT numeric noise; this can be most
 easily seen in the left figure above, where the oscillations are small
 and smooth; it is the Fourier components of this smooth graph that are
 not smooth.
 The calculations are performed with the <a href="https://github.com/linas/anant"
>Algorithmic 'n Analytic Number Theory</a> multi-precision library (based
 on gnuMP); the results are verified by repeating the calculations at various
 different precisions.
 <p> <img width=1024 height=768 src="./fourier-fixed.png"> <p> The zeros seem
 to be scattered very uniformly around the complex plane.
 How many are there? They are easy to count, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.o
rg/wiki/Argument_principle">Cauchy's argument principle</a>: one performs
 an integral of the phase around a circle of radius <i>r</i>; this counts
 the number of zeros inside the circle.
 This counting is easy to perform numerically.
 The result is that there are almost exactly <i>N</i> zeros within radius
 <i>N</i> of the origin, the count being off by no more <i>O(log(r))</i>.
 The surplus or deficit of zeros, as a function of the enclosing radius,
 is shown in the graph below.
 <p> The graph below suggests that the strict bound is <i>1 ± [log(r+1)
 + Mlog(log(r+1)+1)]</i> with equality holding at <i>r=1</i> (there is one
 zeros inside of <i>r=1</i>).
 What's M? Good question.
 If you only graphed out to <i>r=120</i>, you might think that <i>M=1</i>
 is a tight, but good bound.
 Not so, as it fails near <i>r=123</i>.
 So maybe <i>M=2</i>? Sure, that work out to about <i>r=844</i>, where it
 fails.
 So maybe <i>M=3</i>? Sure, that works out to about <i>r=1832</i>, where
 it fails.
 So maybe <i>M=4</i>? Sure, why not, the graph below supports that hypothesis.
 <p> Note that this linear dependence on the radius means that the density
 of zeros is decreasing as the square root -- the area of a circle goes
 as <i>r<sup>2</sup></i>.
 Note that this graph is very compute-intensive to create: it represents
 several CPU-months of calculations.
 <p> <img width=1024 height=768 src="./zero-count-fixed.png"> <p> Below is
 a close-up of what happens near <i>r=1832</i>, where the count surpasses
 one of the hypothesized logarithmic bounds.
 <p> <img width=1024 height=768 src="./zero-count-fixed-1832.png"> <p> A very
 similar-but-very-slightly-different graph holds for <i>EG(ngpf; z)</i>,
 where <i>ngpf(n) = n·gpf(n)</i> (the dot being simple multiplication).
 Two bounds seem acceptable, numerically.
 Aside from that suggested above, another possibility seems to be <i>2 ±
 log(r<sup>2</sup>)</i>, with equality holding at <i>r=1</i> (there are
 three zeros inside of <i>r=1</i>, which is two more than expected).
 The logarithm is so slowly growing, that it's hard to say.
 <p> If you squint and scroll, you might notice that this and the previous
 graph look suspiciously similar.
 Are they the same? No...
 but why so similar? What's the point? For that, we need to look at a movie.
 Oh, by the way: for any fixed radius, it seems that <i>EG(ngpf; z)</i>
 always has about 2 to 6 (sometimes 8 or 10) more zeros than does <i>EG(gpf;
 z)</i>.
 It never-ever seems to have less.
 <img width=1024 height=768 src="./zero-count-Ngpf.png"> <p> Movie time! This
 surprised me, but what do I know? Consider the <i>n</i>'th derivative,
 with respect to <i>z</i>, of <i>EG(gpf; z)</i>.
 Because derivatives of the exponential series yield the series itself,
 this derivative has the effect of acting as a shift operator on <i>gpf</i>.
 That is, define the shift operator <i>S</i> acting on an arithmetic series
 <i>f</i> as <i>(Sf)(n)=f(n+1)</i>.
 It follows that <i>d<sup>n</sup>EG(gpf; z)/dz<sup>n</sup> = EG(S<sup>n</sup>gpf
; z)</i>.
 Where might the zeroes of this function lie? Surprise! The animation below
 shows what happens: each frame is a shift from the prior frame.
 Clearly, the zeros shift towards the origin; but the overall structure
 is preserved.
 Its hard to tell, but it seems that a pair of zeros disappear each frame.
 Although it seems, at first, that the zeros approach the origin uniformly,
 it quickly becomes clear that there is some tidal shearing.
 Careful observation will show that sometimes, one zero races past another
 one.
 <p> There's another interesting thing: towards the end of the movie, on
 the negative x-axis, a pair of mirrored zeros coalesce into one (double)
 zero on the x-axis, and then split apart into two, in sequential order,
 one falling in before the other.
 Something similar also seems to happen on the ray 2&pi;/5, although it
 is not clear if the two zeros actually coalesce before dropping in, or
 if they merely get close.
 At any rate, they start out roughly equidistant from the origin, but then
 fall in at sharply different times.
 <p> I've not verified the coalescing by hand.
 If that is what is really happening, then this appears to be a blatant
 violation that the lanes stay zero-free! This is surely something special
 and meaningful! Since it happens near frame 100 or so, its ...
 well, that's really a pretty big shift, for weird things to start happening.
 Wonder what it means.
 <p> I've never explored the action of shifts on exponential generating
 functions before; this behavior of radial inflow is a complete surprise
 to me.
 It turns out to not be unique to <i>gpf</i>; the exponential generating
 function of shifts of any of the random series discussed above also exhibit
 this kind of flow.
 Its presumably a well-known property of the exponential generating function;
 its just news to me.
 <p> The movie is 108 frames long, starting from a shift of zero.
 The domain is <i>-100 &lt; x,y &lt; +100</i>, and so almost every zero
 initially visible at the start of the movie has fallen into the origin
 by the end of the movie.
 <p> <img width=600 height=600 src="./gpf-exp-deriv-ani.gif"> <p> One last
 image.
 This one is for the <b>reciprocal</b> of the GPF.
 To be precise, its for the absolute value of <i>(1/3) EG(1/gpf; z) exp(-|z|)
 log<sup>3</sup>|z|</i>, with the domain (x,y) ranging from -2160 to +2160,
 and the color scale such that 1.0 or greater is red, 0.5 is green and blue/black
 is 0.25 or less.
 (This is the same color scale as all the other images; however, some of
 the other images are scaled by an arbitrary constant to make them pretty;
 this one is not scaled at all, but is straight as written (with the factor
 of 1/3 in front)).
 The image suggests (of course) that the asymptotic scaling is <i>|EG(1/gpf;
 z)| ~ O(exp|z| log<sup>-3</sup>|z|)</i> or thereabouts.
 <p> Clearly, there's a new feature visible here: rings! Concentric rings!
 Hard to tell, but, pulling out a ruler and eyeballing them, they seem to
 be located at powers of two: the outermost at a radius of 2048, then three
 more clearly visible at 1024, 512 and 256.
 Hard to tell, but there is a vague hint of another ring at 1536=3*512.
 And maybe yet many more rings! Wow! Who knew? <p> <img width=800 height=800
 src="./recip-exp-4320-fixed.png"> <p> I lied.
 That's not the last image -- it pays off to keep making more.
 The below is the same as above, but over a domain ranging from -20K to
 +20K.
 Actually, its slightly different: it shows <i>0.005 EG(1/gpf; z) exp(-|z|)
 log<sup>5</sup>|z|</i>, suggesting the asymptotic <i>|EG(1/gpf; z)| ~ O(exp|z|
 log<sup>-5</sup>|z|)</i> or thereabouts.
 The estimate of the logarithmic terms in the asymptotic behavior is a bit
 ambiguous.
 In this case, the asymptotic term was picked to give the appearance of
 a uniform color balance.
 <p> Newly visible are lines paralleling the positive x-axis, seeming maybe
 to curl around the origin in some vaguely parabolic way.
 There's a particularly large pseudo-parabolic orbit visible, coming in
 from the right, about 3/4th's of the way up, turning around the origin,
 and exiting abut 3/4th's of the way down (on the right, of course -- its
 easy to see, once you see it.) <p> As before, there are hints of Moire patternin
g along the x-axis, although this time, the scale of the picture is such
 that the individual zeros can still be distinctly mad out.
 Therefore, the Moire patterns cannot be <i>optical</i> pixel-scale effects
 -- that is, its not an effect due to the finite size of the pixels -- it
 does not meet the criteria for the classical, canonical definition of the
 Moire effect in a computer graphics image.
 Instead, the Moire patterning seems to actually exist within the function
 itself! This suggests that perhaps the function itself can be decomposed
 as a sum of "layers", each layer consisting of a very regular oscillatory
 pattern, with only the sum of the patterns resulting in the apparent chaos
 of the image.
 <p> What are all these features? How are they to be described? What do
 they correspond to? One can't help but get the sense that this is the projectio
n of some structure on some bundle, some structure built of sheafs and germs,
 but quite how to get that is unclear.
 <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./recip-exp-40K-fixed-lr5.png"> <p> Below
 is same as above, except for a domain of -120K (= -1.2e5) to +120K.
 Note the extremely vague and hard to see hints of parabola-like orbits
 opening to the left (and not just the clearly visible ones opening to the
 right!) There are also hints of other traceries, but its hard to say if
 these are merely optical, visual field effects or if they have some basis
 in mathematical reality.

 easier.
 The below unwinds the the graph from around the origin, showing instead,
 as the above, <i>1.6 EG(1/gpf; z) exp(-|z|) log<sup>-1</sup>|z| log<sup>-4</sup>
[log(|z|+1)+1]</i>, except that here, <i>z=r&nbsp;exp(iθ)</i> with <i>θ</i>

 Along the horizontal axis, <i>r</i> is plotted on a logarithmic scale,
 so that <i>r</i> runs from 1 on the left to 65536 on the right.

 This line is given by <i>sin&nbsp;θ/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/√r</i>.

 Careful examination shows that at least a few zeros appear on the wrong

 Four more lines try to fit the pseudo-parabolas.
 The fits are OK on the large-<i>r</i> asymptotic region, but poor in the
 small-<i>r</i> region.
 The four that are drawn are given by <table cellspacing="10px"> <tr><td>768/r

 approximate ...
 they are obtained by eyeballing.
 I tried to pick integers with a small number of prime factors, and these
 seem pretty close, but there is no obvious pattern that is emerging.
 It is worth spending a few minutes, looking at this under magnification.

<p> That happened to the circles? They should be vertical lines in the above!
 Well, they are still there, just too narrow to be visible in the above.
 They do become visible, below: five evenly spaced vertical lines, using
 the same mapping and logarithmic scaling as above.
 The domain of <i>r</i> is from 1024 on the left to 65536 on the right,
 so the five vertical lines correspond to <i>r=</i>2048, 4096, 8192, 16384,
 and 32768, respectively.
 Otherwise, there is nothing particularly new in this image; everything
 visible here is visible in earlier images.

<p> Just how thin are these vertical lines? The image below is a closeup
 of the image above: in this case, <i>r</i> runs from (32768-650) to (32768+650).
 Eye-balling the red strip, it seems maybe 350 units wide -- so maybe a
 width of √32768=362 is a decent wild guess.
 Is this vertical stripe really zero-free? Hard to tell from this picture.
 There are lots of blue smears -- there are about 1300 zeros in this image
 (as shown above, there are about <i>r</i> zeros inside a circle of radius
 <i>r</i>).
 Fiddling with the color-map helps isolate some of these a bit more clearly,
 and it seems like there might be dozen or two zeros actually within the
 red stripe, rather than all the blue being just a smear from outside the
 stripe.

<p> Below is <i>0.3 EG(1/gpf<sup>2</sup>; z) exp(-|z|)</i>, with the domain
 (x,y) between -2160 and +2160.
 The circular rings become sharply visible.
 The primary sequence seems to be located at powers of 2; so that, here,
 the outermost ring appears to be of radius 2048; the middle one presumably
 with a radius of 1024, etc.
 The other rings are presumably at other prime powers.
 <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./exp-2.0.png"> <p> Below is an actual
 moire pattern! It shows the real part of <i>EG(gpf; z) exp(-|z|)</i>.
 As noted at the very beginning, in the phase portrait, the phase forms
 radially oriented fingers.
 Likewise, the real part of the function consists of radially oriented,
 roughly sinusoidal ridges and valleys.
 At the scale of this image, the distance between peak and trough is less
 than one pixel, and so by using a sharp sampling, one necessarily gets
 a sampling aliasing effect.
 The original image here is 400x400 pixels, and it shows a region <i>0 &lt;
 x,y &lt; 2000</i> (the upper-right quadrant).
 The moire patterning gives a hint about how the radial fingers differ from
 being perfectly radial.
 <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./exp-moire.png"> <p> As above, but for
 the region <i>0 &lt; x,y &lt; 4000</i>.
 Should not be any need to point out that Moire patterning is very sensitive
 to the sampling frequency.

 Below is one for the rising Pochhammer symbol.
 Its normalized by a factorial, for convergence, so really its a binomial
 coefficient.
 Specifically, define <i>RPG(f; z) = &Sigma;<sub>n=1</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>
 f(n) (z)<sub>n</sub> / (n!)<sup>2</sup></i> where <i>(z)<sub>n</sub> =
 z(z+1)(z+2)...(z+n-1)</i> is the rising Pochhammer symbol.
 The two factorials in the denominator guarantee convergence, as otherwise
 the sum is badly behaved.
 The color coding is as before: black is zero, green is about 0.5 and red
 is any value that is 1.0 or larger.
 The leading divergence is removed: the graph shows this: <i>RPG(gpf,z)
 exp(-2 &radic; |z|) / |z|</i> Notice the <i>&radic; |z|</i> in the normalizatio
n: such binomial-coefficient sums (Newton series, actually) are "well-known"
 to diverge in this kind of square-root fashion.
 (This is explored in detail in a paper by Philippe Flajolet and myself
 on Newton series for the Riemann zeta).
 Anyway -- notice again that there seem to be zero-free rays at angles theta=0
 and &pi; of course, and at 2&pi;/3 and, harder to discern, at 2&pi;/5.
 Presumably all the other rationals are there too; they are not very clear
 in this picture.
 The domain in this picture is just huge: -1.0e6 &lt; x,y &lt; 1.0e6 -- this
 is far far wider than any of the previous images: the zeros are much, much
 farther apart.
 <p> <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./poch-rise.png"> <p> One may also
 consider a very similar sum, using the falling Pochhammer symbol, instead
 of the rising one.
 This symbol is given by <i>(z)<sub>n</sub> = z(z-1)(z-2)...(z-n+1)</i>.
 The resulting image appears below, it is of <i>FPG(gpf,z) exp(-2 &radic;
 |z|) / |z|</i> with normalization exactly as given and coloration as always.
 <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./poch-fall.png"> <p> Some of the first
 few zeros for the rising Pochhammer generating function are shown below.
 Note that the first two lie precisely on the real axis.
 The others do not seem to occur at any low rational angle (the column φ
 shows the angle in units of pi, thus a value of φ of one indicates the
 negative x-axis), although the next few seem to try to get close to the
 3rd roots of unity, and the one after that the 6th root of unity.
 After that, there is no clear progression.
 As before, they are presumably transcendental, rather than, for example,
 quadratic irrationals, or some such.

Below is the plot for the rising Pochhammer generating function, just as

Although superficially similar to the other graphs shown previously, this
 is different.
 Note that the zeros far from the origin are clearly distinguishable visually,
 unlike those near the origin: this indicates that the density of zeros
 is falling like the square of the radius, that is, as the area of the graphic.
 This is already suggested by the divergence of the function going as exp
 of the square-root of the radius -- as if the density of zeros is tied
 to the rate of divergence of the function along some radial ray.
 <p> <img width=800 height=800 src="./poch-rise-321M.png"> <p> How many zeros
 are there? As before, we have the curious similarity: the bound on the
 rate of divergence of the function gives the count of the zeros.
 Thus, asymptotically <i>RPG(gpf; z)</i> seems to go roughly as <i>O(|z|
 exp (2 sqrt|z|)</i>.
 The number of zeros inside a circle of radius <i>|z|</i> appears to be
 given by <i>1 + &radic; |z|</i> and the error of this approximation is
 bounded by <i>&pm; [1+log(1+|z|)/2+log(1+log(1+|z|))]</i>, as the graph
 below shows.
 This bound appears to be tight; nothing tighter seems to work.
 Note that this bound extends all the way to <i>|z|=0</i> -- that is, it
 is not violated at small <i>|z|</i>.
