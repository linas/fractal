\begin_layout Title
Ergodicity and Entropy for Black Holes:
\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepstas

\begin_layout Date

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Famously, Hawking relates the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of a black hole to the surface area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of the even horizon as 
\begin_inset Formula $S=A/4$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that there should be some associated micro-canonical ensemble
 on the event horizon, and perhaps some sort ergodic process that is stirring
 the ensemble.
 For example, could the ensemble be a spin connection or something related?
 Could the stirring be provided by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

thermal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 background of small gravitational waves impinging on the event horizon,
 or perhaps something else? This text casually explores some possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Part of the goal here is to scratch around for any kind of theoretical developme
nt that does not involve strings.
 So far, this to the negative.
 Of course, I am starting from square zero, so almost everything contained
 in this text is very naive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Conclusion: the development below doesn't arrive anywhere.
 So, treat this as a diary entry, close it out, and try again, from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current abstract frames the question.
 This is my low-brow attempt to understand things.
 The writing style that will follow below will be extremely informal, loose,
 having the shape of a diary or personal notes, with a lot of editorializing
 and stream-of-consciousness thinking.
 It is not structured as an exposition or some tight article meant for a
 peer-reviewed journal.
 Lots of what will be written down will be half-formed, incorrect, misleading,
 confused.
 Such flaws may or may not be corrected at a later date.
 Frankly, I'm writing this for myself, and not for you.
 Maybe later, the notes here can be converted into something formal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the general setting; my frame of mind in posing this question.
 I'm wondering is there is a non-QFT approach to the problem.
 That is, rather than assuming QFT, Unruh radiation, Hawking radiation,
 etc.
 I'm wondering if there is a classical or semi-classical footing that can
 be given.
 Perhaps this sounds crazy or absurd, since the original Bekenstein and
 Hawking arguments take QFT as foundational.
 But now that it has been given, can we backtrack and find some simpler
 construction that connects conventional dynamical systems and conventional
 geometry, without having to invoke QFT? Perhaps this is foolish, but I'm
 a fool, so there we go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this has something to do with spin connections
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because there is very little else that it could be, if the entropy has
 a classical, non-quantum source.
 That is, my efforts here will be almost entirely based on classical mechanics
 and conventional dynamical systems theory, rather than invoking quantum
 from the get-go.
 The hope is to either find a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 description, and, if not, then expose why there is no such description.
 Now, again, perhaps this sounds foolish, as there is an implicit 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar=1$
\end_inset

 floating around.
 I'm hoping that the presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily imply quantization; so, for example, Fourier transforms
 do not require 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar$
\end_inset

 even though they are conventionally used to construct QM.
 In a similar way, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar$
\end_inset

 is not required to define Poincare duality or any other common concepts
 from differential geometry, even though cohomological results are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

naturally quantized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, more precisely, I'm trying to avoid invoking second quantization and
 Feynmann path integrals.
 I'm entirely happy to call a Dirac field and Pauli exclusion as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

purely classical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 objects.
 Mostly because these follow from Riemannian geometry and from Clifford
 algebras.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps this undertaking is a fools errand, given string theory.
 To recap: string theory can the thought of as being nothing more than a
 harmonic form between 2D and 4D, so that quantum gravity in two dimensions
 is just one end of the harmonic form and (classical) curved spacetime is
 at the other end of the harmonic form.
 This picture ignores the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where do Einsteins field eqns come from?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that's OK, from what I can tell.
 The standard answer is some handwaving about the the field equations come
 from the hydrodynamics of entangled states, or somehing like that.
 So these last few sentences give the orthodox path to understanding the
 ergodicty in black holes, and, given the wieght of evidence, is probably
 the correct way of doing it.
 However, this orthodox path is well-explored, and has many way-points.
 So, byt trying an unorthodix approach, I'm hoping to trip over something
 previously unseen.
 But this is risky, and unlikel to suceed.
 Onward ho!

\begin_layout Itemize

 Viz Unruh, Bekenstein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Write down Dirac eqn at the Swarzschild event horizon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem formulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the very first thing we want to do is to pick a simple case, and explore
 it in the most concrete, direct way possible.
 It seems that this would be to write down spin connections at the event
 horizon of a Swarzschild BH.
 The obvious choice of coordinates is to pick infalling frames, slap vierbeins
 on that, and then write down spinors in the vierbein frame.
 Sounds easy enough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two charts are needed to cover the sphere.
 There's only one way to stitch them together, for the space coords.
 However, there seem to be two ways to glue gamma matrices to the vierbeins,
 +1 and -1 for the (Dirac) gamma matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are there any non-trivial topological maps, twists between the vierbein
 field and the spin complex, besides, this ambiguity about gluing the center
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ +1,-1\right\} $
\end_inset

? Not that I can see, just right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A short note about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fermions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the goal here is to use (ideally) the simplest possible spinors, the Weyl
 spinors.
 From the physics point of view, these correspond to a representation that
 is massless and chiral.
 However, for the low low price of adding complex numbers, we get charge
 conjugation and thus Dirac spinors, which have both massive and massless
 representations.
 Just to make things extra-confusing, there are also Majorana spinors, which
 do not carry a charge.
 As always, Majorana will be short-changed in the discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for charges, I have no plans to look at twists on the conventional
 sense of working with some 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\otimes E$
\end_inset

 for some vector bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 color, isospin...) Doing so seems to pointlessly complicate things, at this
 stage of the game.
 Charge is just 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{spin}_{\mathbb{C}}$
\end_inset

 instead of plain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{spin}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A secondary goal is to avoid talking about spinors, directly.
 I'm not here to write out solutions to the Dirac eqn near a BH.
 That's not the goal, not really.
 I'm hoping that insight can be gained, without having to look at explicit
 solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More interesting is the Kerr metric.
 This may, however, be too much, so we punt on that, for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then...
 lets get to it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, not yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Ergodicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is that the above description does not seem to have room for
 more than one or two distinct (non-isomorphic) spin connections.
 How, exactly, can an ergodic distribution arise? Well, lets rule out some
 possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ergodicity usually implies that there is some underlying measure-preserving
 dynamical system that is driving the time evolution of the system.
 The problem here is the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: anything that is happening in the local frame is going to be infalling,
 so if we stick to just particles, in some traditional sense, then the most
 that we can have is infalling stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, here's something that won't work.
 If we want to create 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 distinct spin connections at the even horizon, (with 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\log N$
\end_inset

 the entropy) well, we can't really, unless we work with at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{spin}_{\mathbb{C}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 a dynamical 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 gauge field to couple to it.
 Now, it does not have to be the full kinematics of E&M, but it does have
 to be enough to create 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 different field+spin connection configurations.
 The issue seems to be that in order to write down a gauge field, I need
 to do it in the proper-time coordinate frame, and these frames fall through
 the event horizon.
 They do not hover there.
 So there's no immediately obvious way to talk about some ergodic distribution
 of fields that just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sits there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the horizon, without it falling in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible solution is to have a background of small gravitational waves
 constantly falling into the horizon.
 This might then serve to keep the spin connection stirred and mixed, following
 some argodic trajectory.
 This stirring could then provide everything needed to drive pair creation
 and thus evaporation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind, the question becomes: will I be able to write down vierbeins
 and a spin connection, located near the event horizon, subject to a stochastic
 background of gravitional waves falling into it? Let's get to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wait, not yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stochastic background needs to include not just GW from distant orbiting
 binary stars, or whatever, but also perhaps GW from energetic processes
 in the accretion disk.
 But it seems weird that we're looking for a mathematical description of
 entropy that requires the existance of stuff outside the BH.
 Thus, we need to also consider GW's created before the formation of the
 BH, GW's that appeared to hover near the EH before finally crossing, and
 providing the required disturbance.
 And I guess this is exactly what the original Hawking model did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, whatever.
 If I can write down the stochastic background, that would be an acheivement.
 So now, I think I'm ready.
 Lets go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh wait, hang on a moment...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Non-holonomic effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the correct way to write down the Dirac eqn in curved spacetime?
 Well, this would seem to have a simple and direct answer: the way that
 it's done in textbooks.
 If I recall correctly, this is done by finding a free-falling, non-rotating
 coordinate frame (vielbeins) and writing the Dirac eqn in that frame.
 The coordinate will always be non-holonomic, expect in trivial cases (flat
 spacetime).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dirac eqn is by itself a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 eqn; it says nothing about QM or QFT.
 To write down QFT, we need to be able to do a sum over paths.
 How is this done in an ambient curved spacetime? Again, the conventional
 answer is to consult standard texts.
 Roughly speaking, this instructs one to think about paths in the manifold
 itself, with path-lengths defined by the metric, and perform sums over
 those.
 The measure over path space is also derived from the metric.
 Hold this thought; it is picked up and worked in greater detail, next major
 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open TODO item: write down the eqns describing a freely falling neutron
 interferometer in a curved spacetime.
 I assume someone has already published these somewhere.
 So find this and review.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Suitable coordinate frames
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of Schwarschild coordinates is ugly for the present problem.
 For one, its an accelerated coordinate frame.
 This means we have to hand-wave about Unruh radiation in accelerated frames,
 and that will ruin lots of other hand-waving that we might want to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lemaitre coordinates provide a non-accelerated frame, describing infalling
 particles that have a velocity of zero at infinity.
 They provide a global synchronous time cooordinate, which is the proper
 time (for the infalling particle).
 The default Lemaitre coords still have a coordinate singularity at the
 event horizon.
 The Painleve chart cures this.
 In the Painleve chart, the spatial frame fields are Euclidean.
 And more: for a fixed time coordinate, the spacial slices are (locally)
 isometric to 3D Eucliden space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps there are other plausible choices.
 I'm thinking this will be determined by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easiest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format for writing GW's at the event horizon.
 And so, what is that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What, exactly, do we want to have here? Are we expecting a precise argument
 about entropy at the horizon, or only far away from it? Hmm.
 I'm confused some more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Spinor dropping into BH
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if we take a classical spinor, either Dirac of Weyl, and drop
 it through the event horizon of a Schwarschild BH? According to physics,
 we expect a rotating BH, of course.
 Mathematically/algebraically, how does this work? How is the spin angular
 momentum of the spinor transformed into a Kerr metric? Naively, this does
 not even seem possible.
 Yet, if I drop in two spinors, i.e.
 a spin-one structure, that should work out, somehow.
 How does this couple/decouple?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a related note: are there any algebraic solutions for a classical, spin-zero
 point mass falling in, radially, into a Schwarschild BH? (Say, in the linearize
d approximation of infinitessimal mass.) How does ring-down work in such
 a case? What is the charateristic timescale for ringdown? Is ringdown approxima
tely exponential? How long does it take? I assume it takes no longer than
 the proper time for the point mass to hit the singularity!?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last is kind-of strange, since it is a statement that the evolution
 of the event-horizon is not analytic.
 That is, the event horizon goes to its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to infinite precision, in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

amount of time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that it takes for a mass to drop to the singularity.
 Or am I misunderstanding, and am merely noting that everything is analytic,
 and just that the radius of convergence of any analytic expansion of the
 motion of the event horizon can never be longer than the proper time? I
 guess its the latter.
 Right? This is ...
 very confusing, also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Past and future
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another confusing thought experiment.
 Suppose one follows a free-falling (non-spinning) geodesic into a Schwarschild
 black hole.
 This is radial motion.
 Suppose that in front of you, there is a free-falling flashlight, aimed
 back at you.
 That is, the flashlight is always closer to the event horizon than you
 are.
 What, exactly, happens, as you cross the event horizon?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the conventional interpretation, the flashlight grows dimmer
 and redshifts as it approaches the horizon, going black as it crosses.
 This is independent of the fact that you are also falling: if it did not
 grow black, then you would be in a position to relay any information back
 out to infinity.
 So, it goes dark, no matter that you are falling after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens after you cross the horizon? I'm slightly confused, but I think
 this is the correct interpretation: I think the answer is that it stays
 dark.
 That is, it has fallen into the future, and cannot affect you in any way.
 It would be nice to work this out in detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now a spherical shell of such lights: in front, to the sides, behind.
 Initialy, these are uniformly distributed and of equal brightness.
 As the observer in the center of this spherical shell, what do you see?
 Without yet having solved the eqns, I hypothesize this: you see the front
 of the shell redshift and grow dark, and then a growing ring at the edge
 to the same, so that a disk (of some angular size) in front of you is dark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conventional interpretation of redshift in flat space is that it arises
 from objects accelerating away from you.
 So, in this sense, increasingly large parts of the sphere have accelerated
 away from you.
 This creates a mild paradox with the conventional description of tidal
 forces, of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spaghettification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which implies squeezing in the orthogonal direction, and stretching along
 the radial direction.
 So for example, the flashlight behind you, is it red-shifted or blue-shifted?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventional narratives talk about brightness.
 and so we have to ask about that as well.
 What, exactly, do we mean by brightness? There are two aspects to tis question.
 First: are there areas where the flashlights appear to bunch up toghether
 (and thus get brighter?) Second: of the narrow cone of emitted light, coming
 from that flashlight, is most of that cone dispersed away from you (thus
 getting dimmer), or is it focused towards you (thus getting brighter?)
 This second question assumes that brightness corresponds to the density
 of incoming null geodesics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above thought experiment was phrased with flashlights, so that we consider
 only those light-like geodesics that connect the flashlight, and you, the
 observer.
 There is now a secondary question: as this flashlights fall, do they continue
 to be aimed at the center of the sphere, or do they twist away in some
 other direction? If so, which direction? What is the formula for that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if the flashlights are replaced by uniform emitters? This situation
 is rather more complicated, as, before the sphere of emitters crosses the
 even horizon, some of those null geodesics can orbit the black hole one
 or more times.
 What happens after all of the shell has fallen through the event horizon?
 Does one still see incoming null geodesics from outside, or do these all
 wink out, before one hits the singularity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orbiting geodesics problem is topologically interesting.
 It is a discretization: each orbit can be assigned an integer.
 In effect, this is a physical process by which a continuum is sliced up
 into discrete parts.
 The slicing of continua into pieces by differential equations is somewhat
 unusual and is interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above treated light as a scalar, without any polarization.
 All calculations have to be redone with the case of polarization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now repeat the exercise with massive particles.
 That is, replace the flashlight by a machine gun shooting BB's at you,
 fixing the mass of the BB, the rate of fire, and the momentum/energy of
 the shot.
 These are the time-like geodesics.
 What do you see? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, repeat the exercise with spinning bullets.
 The spin can be arbitrarily oriented.
 Is there precession?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, repeat this with Weyl spinors.
 These are massless, and follow null geodesics.
 This is somewhat confusing, since along each null geodesic, we have to
 provide a fierbein, so that we can construct the Clifford algebra in the
 fierbein coordinate system, and then construct the Weyl spinors in that
 coordinate system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, one more step: repeat this with classical Dirac point particles.
 So, just like above, we assign to heave timelike geodesic a fierbein, slap
 the Dirac gamma matrices onto it, and then discuss the time evolution of
 Dirac spinors, as they move along these freely-falling geodesics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Huygens sums
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above was a program for determining the behavior of classical particles,
 moving along null or timelike geodesics.
 We now want to repeat the exercise, this time performing Huygens sums.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correct way to do this is to imagine falling with a massless dust of
 robots.
 The job of each robot is to intercept all particles propagating on all
 geodesics that intersect with the robot, perform a sum of all amplitudes
 and phases on those geodesics, and then to become a point emitter, and
 re-radiate that data, uniformly in all directions in that robots local
 free-falling coordinate frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the null geodesics, we need to track not only the frequency (redshift/bluesh
ift) but also a phase.
 The phase is presumably an integral over the proper time along the geodesic.
 This is fine for timelike geodesics, but what about null geodesics? Is
 the phase synchronous along the null geodesic? That is, can we take the
 phase to just be a constant number along the null geodesic? That is, each
 flashlight emits three things: a null geodesic, a complex number (the phase)
 that is held constant on the geodesic, and (optionally) a polarization
 vector that ...
 ?? Does the polarization evolve according to the connection between the
 frame fields, or is it held constant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, when this Huygens sum is performed, is the result the classical
 wave equation in curved spacetime?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the massive particles (time-like geodesics), the phase evolves as a
 clock moving in proper time.
 The Huygens sum will presumably result in the Klien–Gordon equation.
 But this is a hypothesis; it is not obvious that this will actually happen.
 How does all of this work out? What are the details?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the classical point-particle spinors, the Huygens sum presumably results
 in the Weyl wave equation in curved spacetime? Likewise for classical point-par
ticle Dirac spinors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Path integrals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section was written before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Huygens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sections above, and so...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so the above musings are not providing any actionable work items that
 seem likely to produce anything worth-while.
 Lets try a different path, the path of path integrals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two distinct issues come to mind.
 One is Unruh-related, another is holonomy-related.
 Lets think a bit about each, in turn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum-over-paths includes paths that are instantaneously accelerated.
 This includes the sum over paths even in flat spacetime: only the classical
 path is inertial (because its geodesic).
 All the neighboring paths are necessarily non-inertial.
 Somehow, this can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

safely ignored
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, except for obvious divergences in QFT.
 In curved spacetime, this only gets worse.
 For example, in a one-loop diagram, the emitted photon is necessarily in
 a different, accelerated coordinate frame than where it's absorbed.
 This example also evokes Bohm-Aharonov-inspired ideas: is there some spontaneou
s holonomy due to falling through accelerated frames? For example, how does
 a free-falling neutron interferometer work? If its freely falling in flat
 spacetime, then, of course, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nothing happens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But what if its in curved spacetime? Is there some holonomic correction
 due to curvature? How does that work? What are the actual equations for
 that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the tools that we have for sum-over-paths? Let's very quickly review
 these.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Accelerons and billiards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment, let's stick to notions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trajectories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Paths in coordinate space of some manifold.
 Let's consider a path that is near a geodesic.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

near
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close to an extrema of the action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Such a path necessarily experiences instantaneous acceleration.
 Can I, should I imagine that this instantaneous accelaration is accomplsihed
 by the emmision and absorption of graviton-like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accelerons
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? If such a nearby path starts and ends at the same point as a geodesic,
 then it seems like it would need to emit and absorb an equal number of
 accelerons.
 These are conserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems I should think of these accelerons coming from some sort of thermal
 bath.
 This allows one to consider not just one path, but many paths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this a billiard model? Instead of having a hard gas, I want to consider
 a model of fermions bouncing from discrete, point-like accelerons.
 Thus, parotting Sinai's billiards, I place a single (soft?) acceleron in
 a cube with periodic boundary conditions, and consider a classical fermion
 following a classical trajectory, bouncing off of this.
 Is this concrete enough to be tractable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simplifying further, can I think of a sequence of accelerons hitting a fermion
 to be a kind-of Bernoulli process? This seems concrete enough to be doable
 in 1+1 dimensional spacetime.
 Surely, someone has published on this, too?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open TODO item: this seems like its simple enough to be actually doable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, the interaction should be soft, not hard: the collisions should
 not be point-like, instantaneous changes of momentum, but soft, elastic
 changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One challenge is to describe the shape of the path, after it has been hit
 by a large number of accelerons.
 Based on experience with brownian motion, such paths should be brownian
 random walks.
 This conclusion appears to be general: no matter what precise form the
 interactions take, the actual paths are ultimately chaotic, ergodic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This line of reasoning leads to an apparent paradox.
 We start with a trajectory that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close to an extremum of the action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and pertrub it, by hitting it with a large number of accelerons, to get
 another trajectory that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

close to an extremum of the action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However, the natural thermal process instead says that this perturbed trajector
y should resemble a brownian walk.
 This feels paradoxial.
 Can we resolve it? Yes, in two different ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way is to describe the geodesic as a mean motion, an average, and the
 actual motion is a Brownian walk superimposed on that.
 That is, the actual path is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(t\right)=\gamma\left(t\right)+b\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the geodesic, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is a brownian path, equidistributed around the origin, stationary, having
 no expected change in position over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task is then twofold: describe 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 and then provide a microscopic model for 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 that makes it look like some sort of interaction with a thermal bath of
 accelerons.
 The first task has a very conventional answer, provided by Feynman, and
 sketched in Appendix C.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Sum over paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Feynman sum over paths, as sketched in Appendix C, provide an orthodox,
 canonical description of physics.
 (Actually Appendix C includes some extra, non-standard twists from Witten;
 we leave thos in the background, for now.) This section attempts to interpret
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meaning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of that appendix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting point is to take, in a literal sense, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and to take it to specifically be a path in coordinate space, a change
 of position over time.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Apologia: in string theory, we'd consider a string, rather than a path.
 That's all well and fine, but nothing in the current line of reasoning
 forces a string viewpoint.
 Thus, just to keep things simple, this section focuses on paths of point
 particles.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This poses a challenge: how to write down a collection of paths, in such
 a way that they cover some manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 in some space-filling or maybe some ergodic way.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ergodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a specific, narrow definition, so we must be carefull with it's use.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

space-filling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implies that the collection of paths will come arbitrarily close to every
 point in the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 might be Minkowski space, or it might be some manifold in general, or some
 subset of a (psuedo-)Riemannian manifold.
 Thus, in formulas, we are looking for a function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi:\left[0,1\right]\times S\to M
\]

\end_inset

for some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 is dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 More precisely, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 has to be dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

, the tangent manifold.
 That is, not only must 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 come close to every point in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, but the derivative
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\varphi}\left(t,s\right)=\left.\frac{d\varphi\left(t,s\right)}{dt}\right|_{s=\mbox{const}}
\]

\end_inset

has to come close to every tangent vector in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}M$
\end_inset

 for every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 There is also a third condition: the 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\varphi}$
\end_inset

 will be appearing as the kinetic terms in some Lagrangian, and, in general,
 the action will need to be finite.
 Thus, one needs that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int dt\left\Vert \dot{\varphi}\left(t,s\right)\right\Vert ^{2}<\infty
\]

\end_inset

for some suitable metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

? Well, for starters, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 cannot be a finite set.
 A single space-filling curve could cover all of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and, with some work, could also cover all of 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

 but, in that case, it would fail to have a finite kinetic term.
 (This is presumably obvious.) Thus, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 has to be at least countable.
 Can it be uncountable? Well, not really, because we have a fourth condition
 to satisfy: we are trying to write down a measure of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\left[d\varphi\right]\exp-\beta A
\]

\end_inset

for some action 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The integral part 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\varphi\right]$
\end_inset

 is understood to be a sum over all paths parameterized by the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is uncountable, then we have formal difficulties with defining the integral.
 Our imagination allows us to imagine 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\varphi\right]$
\end_inset

 as a countable sum over infinitessimals; it does not stretch so far as
 to be an uncountable sum over infinitessimals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this is all very abstract; perhaps too abstract.
 There four distinct tasks in front of us.
 One is to write down a plausible version of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 that is dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

.
 Another is to write down 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 so that it is a convenient parameter.
 We've already concluded that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 has to be countable, so we could just use the natural numbers, but this
 might not be entirely 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

convenient
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 More in just a moment.
 Third, we have to write down some explicit expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left[d\varphi\right]$
\end_inset

 that is tractable, and, fourth, to write down the measure
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu=\left[d\varphi\right]\exp-\beta A
\]

\end_inset

so that it is also tractable.
 Note the above does not have the integral symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset

 in it, and we wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu$
\end_inset

 for the measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Parameterizing paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets now try to construct some plausible 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 We'll do this in several steps.
 First, fix some smooth curve 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma:\left[0,1\right]\to M
\]

\end_inset

This can be any curve, but the intent is that it will probably be a geodesic,
 at the end.
 Next, select a path 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}^{n}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the tangent bundle.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}M\approx\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 at each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, and we are using the atlas to reinterpret, by abuse of notation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi:\left[0,1\right]\to TM
\]

\end_inset

such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi\left(t\right)\in T_{\gamma\left(t\right)}M
\]

\end_inset

Having picked such a 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, we then use the exp map to create the final curve 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi\left(t\right)=\gamma\left(t\right)\exp\psi\left(t\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is to be read as saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

starting at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\gamma\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, use polar coordinates to travel in a direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, for a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\left(t\right)\right|$
\end_inset

, to arrive at a new point 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime}=\varphi\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Holding 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 fixed, it should be apparent that all we really need is a family of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 that is dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 in order to arrive at a family of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 that is dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 What is not yet obvious is that this construction is dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

.
 To get dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

, we need to consider all diffeomorphisms in the paramter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Well, one thing at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How should we parameterize a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

? Well, the traditional, conventional choice in QM textbooks is to use some
 family of orthonormal functions on the unit interval.
 In order to get a reasonable parameterization, this family must exhibit
 uniform convergence on the unit interval.
 In Appendix D, we consider a wavelet basis, as opposed to some more convetional
 orthoganl polynomials or even a discrete fourier basis.
 Why wavelets? Because they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: they allow one to consider a variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 that is localized to some small region of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

; this localized variation corresponds to a specific, local subset of the
 wavelets.
 By contrast, a discrte sine & cosine basis requires tweaking all of the
 expansion coefficients, not just some of them, when considering a small
 variation in the path.
 This makes writing delta-epsilon changes harder, and showing uniform convergenc
e harder.
 I think.
 It seems like the localized properties of wavelets should be appealing
 when working with explicit paths that are explicitly in coordinate space.
 Except maybe not.
 See next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It does, however, raise a problem.
 Conventional Feynman path integrals are done in momentum space, and not
 in coordinate space.
 This is because of an Ansatz: one moves from position to momentum via Fourier
 transforms.
 Well, this works great in flat space (including Minkowski space) but gets
 awkward in curved spacetime.
 I've done my share of reading of texbooks in differential geometry, and
 am aware that, in principle, there's Poincare duality and all sorts of
 related ideas that can be used to argue that, whatever we do in position
 space, we can do in momentum space.
 However, I have not seen, anywhere, any explicit expressions that show
 how to do Fourier transforms near a black hole, never mind at the event
 horizon.
 Perhaps such expressions exist, and I just have not read widely enough
 to have seen them...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us into a tedious situation: lots of calculations need to be
 done.
 Ugh.
 I hate long calculations.
 Anyway, here's the sketch:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formalize the wavelet basis enough to be usable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formalize the construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 given above to be usable.
 In particular, this requires taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 to be a freely falling particle, with an attached vielbein giving us a
 coordinate frame, in which the exp map has an explicit form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To cover all of 
\begin_inset Formula $TM$
\end_inset

, we need to also work with all diffeomorphisms of the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We need to compute the action for each path 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 and we need to weight it, and finally obtain a measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then we need to ...
 umm ...
 Why were we doing all this, again? The original goal was to get either
 some kind of explict model of ergodicity on the event horizon, or to obtain
 some sort of quantum theory near the horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the first four bullets seem to be within reach.
 Perhaps a bit of a grind, to write it all out, but doable, as a general
 program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fifth bullet is a challenge.
 Now, in one certain sense, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to write down QFT in curved spacetime.
 One just writes D instead of d and throws in the Christoffel symbols in
 all of the approriate places and voila, done! Small, compact expressions
 that can be found in numerous texts.
 But these expressions do not give us an adequate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model of what is happening at the event horizon.
 This shortcoming is illustrated by the so-called firewall paradox, if nothing
 else.
 There are missing details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the daydream here is that the wavelet basis should help us write down
 a QFT at the event horizon.
 If that's the goal, then the fifth bullet point is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How does one write down wave functions, and entangled wave functions, using
 a coordinate-space path integral? Specifically, how do I entangle a wave
 function on one side of the even horizon with a wave function on the other
 side? Or should I be talking about quantized fields, not wave functions?
 Huh?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem here is that conventional QFT asks us to solve the Klein-Gordon
 eqn, then to write down ladder operators for it, and finally, do this near
 the horizon, and then to imagine some kind of complex vacuum, some bubbling
 Dirac sea of particle-hole pairs near the horizon.
 My imagination breaks down there.
 I cannot imagine this vacuum.
 I want to see explicit expressions, showing how this is done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Coordinate path basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above section discusses the possibility of explicitly performing sums
 over coordinate paths, and idley suggests that a wavelet basis might be
 better than a fourier basis.
 But is this the case? Maybe not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary successs of the Fourier basis is due to Newton's 2nd Law in
 flat space.
 In a vacuum, in a non-interacting environment, in flat space, a moving
 mass moves at constant momentum.
 The momentum distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(p-p_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding wave is a plane wave 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{ikx}$
\end_inset

.
 This is the philosophical reason why plane waves provide the prefered basis
 for QFT in Minkowski space.
 There's also a second reason: conservation of energy.
 The kinetic term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(d\varphi/dt\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

 is translation-invariant.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 a plane-wave, the kinetic terms is trivially 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a wavelet in flat space, it's a bit silly.
 So, in a wavelet basis
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi\left(t\right)=\sum_{n,0\le m\le2^{n}}a_{n,m}f\left(2^{n}t-m\right)
\]

\end_inset

for a mother wavelet 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, the kinetic term just becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\sum_{n}2^{n}\sum_{0\le m\le2^{n}}a_{n,m}\right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset

with the second sum illustrating the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

silliness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the wavelet basis: the wavelet basis was not translation-invariant (by
 construction), but the kinetic term is translation-invariant, and so the
 second sum is just a sum over all translated versions of the wavelet.
 In flat space, this is quite pointless and silly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we arrive at an impass.
 We're interested in writing down an orthonormal basis in curved space.
 The fourier transform is problematic: the need to integrate over the entire
 real line, the implicit conservation of momentum implied by plane waves.
 These two properties make it ideal for flat space, but problematic for
 curved space with either coordinate singularities or real singularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wavelet basis is hardly any better.
 The wavelets are localized, but even then, there's a built-in assumption
 of flatness at the local scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the correct, best basis for arbitrary paths in curved spacetime?
 I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Proper time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When one writes down some arbitrary path through spacetime, there arises
 the problem of assigning a numeric value to the integral of the kinetic
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{T}dt\left(d\varphi/dt\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

 for that path.
 What is the correct metric for the time, along that curve? There are several
 possibilities(!!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue is that any diffeomorphic rescaling of the time coordinate along
 the curve gives the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same curve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in coordinates, but assigns a different energy to it.
 Thus, the sum over paths cannot be just a sum over spatially distinct paths,
 but also a sum over diffeomorphic rescalings of the time coordinate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Entanglement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There does not seem to be any point in moving pursuing earlier path integral
 propsals, until we have a clear answer on entanglement.
 So lets ponder that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventional ideas of entanglement start with the idea of a qubit, and then
 take two of them, and entangle them in some pure state.
 For the present purposes, we replace the qubit by a spinor, and entanglement
 by the representation theory of 
\begin_inset Formula $SL\left(2,\mathbb{C}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The algebra for that is textbook standard, for zero-dimensional space.
 For the present situation, there are several conceptual problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Write down a spinor field that can be defined at all points of a spacetime
 manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 This field does NOT have to be a solution of the Dirac wave eqn (or Weyl
 wave eqn, etc.) because we are NOT looking for classical fields.
 Instead, we want to write fields that are smooth (or at least differentiable)
 on the path construction above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Write down expressions for an entangled pair of spinors, such that the entanglem
ent is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In particular, that a measurement performed on the entangled field in one
 region of spacetime implies the correct QM behavior in another region of
 spacetime.
 The fact that these two regions or on opposite sides of the event horizon
 should not matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first bullet seems almost trivial: just write down some spinor field,
 any spinor field, willy-nilly.
 Again, we're assuming that there are vielbeins for everywhere on the spacetime
 manifold, and these provide a local free-falling frame, so the spinor field
 is always unambiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second bullet is harder.
 I'm finding it confusing.
 I think it means that the entanglement must be everywhere, for all spacetime
 points.
 So, for example, if entagled state is a singlet, then it must be a singlet
 everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One severe issue is that of Bell inequalities.
 That is, given a singlet, if Alice measures 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Bob had better measure 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 But what direction is the z-axis? To get a valid Bell inequality, Alice
 and Bob have to start out at the same spot, and then carry thier non-spinning
 reference frames with them, whereever they go.
 But, they must also carry the spinor with them, too.
 If they don't do this, and the spinor is in some other coordinate frame,
 then the spinor's idea of up and down will not match Alice and Bob's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is, Alice and Bob can certainly do a parallel transport of a common
 lab reference frame, but that transport is path dependent.
 Curved spacetime is not parallelizable (except in teleparallel theories,
 in which case the slack is picked up by torsion.
 And we've been trying to avoid discussions of torsion, until now.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what is the correct way to parallel-transport the reference frame for
 a spinor? Is the correct answer that each spinor of the entangled pair,
 once created, must be allowed to fall in an inertial frame, i.e.
 along the classical geodesic? That's fine, and works great, for a classical
 point particle having spin-1/2 but if we're doing quantum, then not so
 much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we allow for a massive spin-1/2 quantum particle, then we can freefall
 with it.
 In the lab frame, the QM wave-function for that particle should slowly
 expand, in a sphere-symmetric fashion, per Heisenberg uncertainty, derived
 from the localization of the initial position/momentum.
 That is, both Alice and Bob fall along with the spinor, and the lab frames
 fall with, and everything is OK.
 This seems to work if the curvature is relatively small to the position/momentu
m uncertainty.

It does imply that, when we go to do the path integral, we will need to
 perform parallel transport along each path in the path integral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, we seem to have arrived at a Bell measurement theorm: in order to
 get measurements that are in line with the Bell inequality, we must transport
 the reference frames along whichever geodesic the expectation value of
 the spinor location goes.
 That's a pretty strong constraint.

I still find this mildly confusing; I'm not convinced I'm thinking about

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Coordinate charts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A generic coordinate chart for a manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi:U\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=\left(\varphi^{1},\varphi^{2},\cdots,\varphi^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U\subset M$
\end_inset

 an open set.
 We'll eventually set 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 and works with conventional 1+3 spacetime, but it's OK to leave this open
 for now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gradients of a scalar field on 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 provide the coordinate basis for a vector field.
 That is, given 
\begin_inset Formula $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 introduce the notation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{\mu}f\equiv\frac{\partial\left(f\circ\varphi^{-1}\right)}{\partial x^{\mu}}
\]

\end_inset

The conventional abuse of notation is to forget about 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

 and write 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\varphi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}=\varphi^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{\mu}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}
\]

\end_inset

This provides a coordinate basis for vector fields:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{X}=X^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}=X^{\mu}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}
\]

\end_inset

The same abuse of notation is used to write 1-forms as 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}=d\varphi^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}\left(\partial_{\nu}\right)=\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 A greek-letter index is used here; roman letter indexes are reserved for
 the vielbeins (later).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Metric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use boldface for the metric tensor:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{g}=g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}=dx^{\mu}\otimes dx^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and sometimes we'll explicitly write the tensor product symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 to and sometimes not.
 The tensor components are then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\mu\nu}=\mathbf{g}\left(\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The use of coordinate charts in this way (eventually) implies that the connectio
n is torsion-free.
 This allows one to safely assume that the metric tensor is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}=g_{\nu\mu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is both good and bad.
 The good news is that a symmetric metric and a torsion-free connection
 makes all manipulations simple and safe.
 The bad news is that it prevents us from exploring the relationship between
 torsion and spin.
 Which, I think, is interesting to explore.
 Some other day.
 The easiest route to exploring torsion is to abandon the use of a metric,
 and instead to start with a frame bundle, and then work with generic connection
s, which may have torsion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Vielbeins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frame field that we wish to work with is the one that is flat and orthonorma
l at each point on the manifold.
 That is, at each point, we want 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\left\{ 1,2,\cdots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Orthonormal just means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{e}_{a}\cdot\vec{e}_{b}=\left\langle \vec{e}_{a},\vec{e}_{b}\right\rangle =\eta_{ab}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is the flat metric.
 When specializing to spacetime, this will be the Minkowski metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{X}=X^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 for vector fields with respect to the local coordinate chart 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

, one write the frame fields as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{e}_{a}=e_{a}^{\;\mu}\partial_{\mu}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all there is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to this, but some gymnastics is kind of fun, because the resulting algebraic
 expressions are suggestive, even if they do not carry any additional meaning
 beyond the above.
 And so, here we go.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{ab}=\vec{e}_{a}\cdot\vec{e}_{b}=\left\langle \vec{e}_{a},\vec{e}_{b}\right\rangle =e_{a}^{\;\mu}e_{b}^{\;\nu}\left\langle \partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu}\right\rangle =e_{a}^{\;\mu}e_{b}^{\;\nu}\mathbf{g}\left(\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu}\right)=e_{a}^{\;\mu}e_{b}^{\;\nu}g_{\mu\nu}
\]

\end_inset

I'm going to skip all the tangent/cotanget gymnastics, which boils down
 to the statement that raising and lowering of indexes proceeds as usual.
 That is, the matrix inverse is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{\;\mu}^{a}=g_{\mu\nu}\eta^{ab}e_{b}^{\;\nu}
\]

\end_inset

Other expected identies follow, such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{ab}e_{\;\mu}^{a}e_{\;\nu}^{b}
\]

\end_inset

Well, I'm bored.

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the metric,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{g}=g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}\otimes dx^{\nu}
\]

\end_inset

and plugging in for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{g}=\eta_{ab}\left(e_{\;\mu}^{a}dx^{\mu}\right)\otimes\left(e_{\;\nu}^{b}dx^{\nu}\right)=\eta_{ab}\sigma^{a}\otimes\sigma^{b}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{a}=e_{\;\mu}^{a}dx^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal one-form in the cotangent space.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma^{a}\left(\vec{e}_{b}\right)=\delta_{b}^{a}
\]

\end_inset

follows from 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}\left(\partial_{\nu}\right)=\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

\begin_layout Subsection*
Schwarzschild metric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Schwarschild metric in Schwarschild coordinates, using the coordinate
 cobasis:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{g}=\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)dt\otimes dt-\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}\,dr\otimes dr-r^{2}\left(d\theta\otimes d\theta+\sin^{2}\theta\,d\phi\otimes d\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $m=GM/c^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the mass.
 The Schwarschild radius is 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{s}=2m$
\end_inset

.
 The expression is valid only for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{s}<r$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing this to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{g}=\eta_{ab}\sigma^{a}\otimes\sigma^{b}=\sigma^{0}\otimes\sigma^{0}-\sigma^{1}\otimes\sigma^{1}-\sigma^{2}\otimes\sigma^{2}-\sigma^{3}\otimes\sigma^{3}
\]

\end_inset

we immediately read off coframe as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{0} & =\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}dt\\
\sigma^{1} & =\frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}\\
\sigma^{2} & =rd\theta\\
\sigma^{3} & =r\sin\theta\,d\phi
\end{align*}

\end_inset

From this, we deduce the frame field
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\vec{e}_{0} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}\partial_{t}\\
\vec{e}_{1} & =\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}\partial_{r}\\
\vec{e}_{2} & =\frac{1}{r}\partial_{\theta}\\
\vec{e}_{3} & =\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\partial_{\phi}
\end{align*}

\begin_layout Subsection*
Lie brackets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are ten Lie brackets for the frame field.
 Its a homework problem to compute them.
 I'm not sure this will teach anything, but lets try anyway.
 First, lets get rid of the trivial ones:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{e}_{0},\vec{e}_{0}\right]=\left[\vec{e}_{0},\vec{e}_{2}\right]=\left[\vec{e}_{0},\vec{e}_{3}\right]=\left[\vec{e}_{1},\vec{e}_{1}\right]=\left[\vec{e}_{2},\vec{e}_{2}\right]=\left[\vec{e}_{3},\vec{e}_{3}\right]=0
\]

\end_inset

That leaves four 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interesting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cases.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{e}_{0},\vec{e}_{1}\right]=\frac{m}{r^{2}\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)}\partial_{t}=\frac{m}{r^{2}\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}\vec{e}_{0}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{e}_{1},\vec{e}_{2}\right]=\frac{-\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}{r^{2}}\partial_{\theta}=\frac{-\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}{r}\vec{e}_{2}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{e}_{1},\vec{e}_{3}\right]=\frac{-\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}{r^{2}\sin\theta}\partial_{\phi}=\frac{-\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}}{r}\vec{e}_{3}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\vec{e}_{2},\vec{e}_{3}\right]=\frac{-\cos\theta}{r^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}\partial_{\phi}=\frac{-1}{r\tan\theta}\vec{e}_{3}
\]

\end_inset

and I think I did all of these correctly, but I cannot promise there are
 no mistakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, the upshot is that its fairly unenlightening.
 I'm not sure what I've learned here.
 The last one is just standard commutator for sphere coordinates.
 (Recall, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\pi/2$
\end_inset

 at the equator, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=0,\pi$
\end_inset

 at the poles.) The first one just says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time goes slower for the guy closer to the horizon
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 That is, when comparing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, minus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

move radially inwards, then move forward one second
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gives a positive displacement in time.
 The direction is inwards, not outwards, because the friggin minus sign
 on the metric, right? (I'm confused about the direction.) The second and
 third commutators are just saying that radial movements compress the scales,
 but don't actually change sphere directions; there's a tidal compression
 in the mapping.
 Also, the sphere directions are non-rotating.
 All this is as it should be; nothing we didn't already know.

mother wavelet
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that it is zero on the boundaries, ideally with derivative zero at the

 Then, given a finite-length bit-string 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{k};k=1,\cdots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 define the wavelet 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\left\{ b\right\} }:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$

 as
\begin_inset Formula

w_{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(t\right)=w\left(t;\left\{ b_{k}\right\} \right)=\begin{cases}
w\left(2^{n}t-c_{\left\{ b\right\} }\right) & \frac{c_{\left\{ b\right\} }}{2^{n}}\le t\le\frac{c_{\left\{ b\right\} }+1}{2^{n}}\\

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 corresponds one-to-one to a dyadic rational

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)\approx\sum_{\left\{ b\right\} }a_{\left\{ b\right\} }w_{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(t\right)
\]

\end_inset

The above is not quite correct, because we've arranged the 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

 to vanish at the dyadic rationals.
 I need to crack open a book on wavelets to get a more precise definition,

 Alongside this are a collection of Jacobi fields, which we use to define
 nearby paths.

Well, or we can use the vielbeins, instead.
 That is, given a set of vielbeins along a path 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 (that is not necessarily freely-falling, i.e.
 is not necessarily a geodesic), we use the wavelet basis to define nearby
 paths.
 More precisely, given 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 different constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

, we want to use these to define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nearby path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To be usable as a path, we must have some mechanism for defining the path
 length on it, i.e.
 of providing a unit velocity on it.
 Ugh.

Hypothesis: what happens if I multiply

 into the Kerr fierbein? The former is a generator of rotations.
 How does it act on Kerr? This should be easy.
 Can we do it? Lets slap some stuff down on the page.

Lemaître frame

\begin_layout Standard
First, the Lemaître frame for Schwarszchild.
 This frame is for a freely-falling, non-spinning point particle.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\vec{f}_{0} & =\partial_{T}-\sqrt{\frac{2m}{r}}\partial_{r}\\
\vec{f}_{1} & =\partial_{r}\\
\vec{f}_{2} & =\frac{1}{r}\partial_{\theta}\\
\vec{f}_{3} & =\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\partial_{\phi}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ds^{2}=dT^{2}-\left(dr+\sqrt{\frac{2m}{r}}dT\right)^{2}-r^{2}\left(d\theta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta\,d\phi^{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Note that for constant 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 (by abuse of notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $dT=0$
\end_inset

) the spatial part of the metric is the flat-space metric.

 The relation between

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
t\left(T,r\right) & =T+\int\frac{\sqrt{2m/r}}{1-2m/r}dr\\
 & =T-2m\left(2y-\log\left(\frac{y-1}{y+1}\right)\right)
