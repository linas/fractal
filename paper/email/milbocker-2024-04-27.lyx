Hi Michael,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You wrote me a confusing email, so I will try to respond here in the simplest
 and plainest fashion that I can.
 I will use language that is so plain and simple that even undergrads should
 be able to follow; so excuse me if it seems too simple.
 The goal is to avoid confusion and misunderstanding.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Spectral basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets say we have some Hamiltonian operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and we are able to solve it to find a discrete eigenvalue spectrum for
 it:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\psi_{n}=\omega_{n}\psi_{n}
\]

\end_inset

Written in this form, this 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 could be anything: a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating airplane wing,
 the Schroedinger eqn for the hydrogen atom, a radar cavity for some electronics
, a harmonic operator on some quotient of Lie algebras, a Dirac operator
 on some n-dimensional spacetime.
 Don't care, doesn't matter as long as the spectrum is discrete (and thus
 countable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenfunctions are assumed to be orthonormal.
 Pick your favorite notation, I don't care:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{mn}=\left\langle \psi_{m}\vert\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\int\overline{\psi_{m}}\psi_{n}=\left\langle m\vert n\right\rangle =\int\overline{\psi_{m}}\left(x\right)\psi_{n}\left(x\right)dx
\]

\end_inset

Whatever, its all good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In bra-ket notation, of course one writes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\omega_{n}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left\langle \psi_{n}\right|H\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and note that this expression is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 even for guitar strings! This has nothing to do with quantum.
 It's generic for any operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue is that, for guitar strings, the eigenvalues are unbounded: 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}=2\pi n/L$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 the length of the guitar string, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\left(2\pi/L\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n$
\end_inset

 and the sum is not convergent: the expectation value is infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a generic problem: Hamiltonians have spectrums that are unbounded.
 For radar cavities, the radial part has 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 similar to the guitar string, but sphere symmety means sphere harmonics
 which means there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\left(\ell+1\right)$
\end_inset

 of them for each radial excitation, and so the sum goes like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle \sim\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n^{3}$
\end_inset

 which is even more divergent.
 For general 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional space, it will go like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle \sim\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n^{D}$
\end_inset

.
 This includes harmonic operators (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave equations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) on homogeneous spaces, which are quotients of Lie groups.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It gets interesting when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a Dirac operator.
 In this case, the spectrum is both positive and negative.
 If the spectrum is perfectly symmetric, so that for each positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 there is exactly one other 
\begin_inset Formula $-\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

, one can argue (hand-wave) that these should exactly cancel one-another
 to get exactly zero.
 The sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 is now 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conditionally convergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It's not absolutely convergent in the formal mathematical sense.
 The whole point of regulators is to deal with this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, for Dirac operators, if the positive spectrum almost pairs up with
 the negative spectrum, but not quite, then you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

split the difference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 now measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectral asymmetry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the spectrum is perfectly symmetric, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 but otherwise its not.
 There are some famous theorems about this; the most important of these
 is the Atiyahâ€“Singer theorem.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a quasi repeat of my earlier email, but now in the Hamiltonian setting.
 Given some complex number 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}=\sum_{n}\omega_{n}\left|\omega_{n}\right|^{-s}
\]

\end_inset

As a general rulewhich
