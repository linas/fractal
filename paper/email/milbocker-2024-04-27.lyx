Hi Michael,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You wrote me a confusing email, so I will try to respond here in the simplest
 and plainest fashion that I can.
 I will use language that is so plain and simple that even undergrads should
 be able to follow; so excuse me if it seems too simple.
 The goal is to avoid confusion and misunderstanding.

Spectral basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets say we have some Hamiltonian operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and we are able to solve it to find a discrete eigenvalue spectrum for
 it:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\psi_{n}=\omega_{n}\psi_{n}
\]

\end_inset

Written in this form, this 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 could be anything: a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating airplane wing,
 the Schroedinger eqn for the hydrogen atom, a radar cavity for some electronics
, a harmonic operator on some quotient of Lie groups, a Dirac operator on
 some n-dimensional spacetime.
 Don't care, doesn't matter as long as the spectrum is discrete (and thus
 countable).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenfunctions are assumed to be orthonormal.
 Pick your favorite notation, I don't care:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{mn}=\left\langle \psi_{m}\vert\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\int\overline{\psi_{m}}\psi_{n}=\left\langle m\vert n\right\rangle =\int\overline{\psi_{m}}\left(x\right)\psi_{n}\left(x\right)dx
\]

\end_inset

Whatever, its all good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In bra-ket notation, of course one writes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\omega_{n}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left\langle \psi_{n}\right|H\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and note that this expression is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 even for guitar strings! This has nothing to do with quantum.
 It's generic for any operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this sum is absolutely convergent, then such an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trace class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_class For the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is not an operator, but is instead a map between spaces, see https://en.wikipedi
a.org/wiki/Nuclear_operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to simple things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue is that, for guitar strings, the eigenvalues are unbounded: 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}=2\pi n/L$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 the length of the guitar string, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\left(2\pi/L\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n$
\end_inset

 and the sum is not convergent: the expectation value is infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a generic problem: Hamiltonians have spectrums that are unbounded.
 For radar cavities, the radial part has 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 similar to the guitar string, but sphere symmetry means sphere harmonics
 which means there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\left(\ell+1\right)$
\end_inset

 of them for each radial excitation, and so the sum goes like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle \sim\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n^{3}$
\end_inset

 which is even more divergent.
 For general 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional space, it will go like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle \sim\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n^{D}$
\end_inset

.
 This includes harmonic operators (aka 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wave equations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) on homogeneous spaces, which are quotients of Lie groups.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It gets interesting when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a Dirac operator.
 In this case, the spectrum is both positive and negative.
 If the spectrum is perfectly symmetric, so that for each positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 there is exactly one other 
\begin_inset Formula $-\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

, one can argue (hand-wave) that these should exactly cancel one-another
 to get exactly zero.
 The sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 is now 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conditionally convergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It's not absolutely convergent in the formal mathematical sense.
 The whole point of regulators is to deal with this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BTW, for Dirac operators, if the positive spectrum almost pairs up with
 the negative spectrum, but not quite, then you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

split the difference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}$
\end_inset

 now measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectral asymmetry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If the spectrum is perfectly symmetric, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\omega_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 but otherwise its not.
 There are some famous theorems about this; the most important of these
 is the Atiyahâ€“Singer theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Regulators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a quasi-repeat of my earlier email, but now in the Hamiltonian setting.
 Given some complex number 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}=\sum_{n}\omega_{n}\left|\omega_{n}\right|^{-s}
\]

\end_inset

For the guitar string example, ignore the assorted constants and take 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}=n$
\end_inset

 for positive 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 only.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n\left|n\right|^{-s}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{-s+1}
\]

\end_inset

and this sum is absolutely convergent for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>2$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\sigma+i\tau$
\end_inset

 are the real and imaginary parts of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 More interesting is that this is just some plain-old complex-analytic series,
 and can be analytically continued to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 complex plane.
 It has a simple pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

 and no poles anywhere else.
 Simple pole means it behaves like 
\begin_inset Formula $1/s$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

 and so now one can talk about the expression
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}=\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}-\frac{1}{s}
\]

\end_inset

and make some hand-waving arguments about how 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}$
\end_inset

 is the vacuum expectation value for a vibrating guitar string, after removal
 of the divergences.
 In fact, for the guitar string, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let me take the conventional big leap.
 If one studies quantum field theory, using the standard formalism used
 in the 1960's through 1990's, one discovers that the quantized bosonic
 field looks more-or-less like a guitar-string at every point in spacetime.
 More formally, it is a simple harmonic oscillator at every point in spacetime.
 Well, actually, it is a simple harmonic oscillator at every point in momentum
 space, and it was wrong to talk about position space, because in momentum
 space, the propagator blah-blah-blah.
 For the hand-waving part, it is sufficient to claim that there's an SHO
 at every point, and since the SHO has 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}=n+1/2$
\end_inset

 you plug through the sum above to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}$
\end_inset

 and you remove the the obvious simple pole to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}$
\end_inset

 and since its a non-interacting bosonic field, its 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}=0$
\end_inset

 or I guess its 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{\mbox{finite}}=1/2$
\end_inset

; I'm too lazy to do the sum and the analytic continuation: this is just
 the Hurwicz zeta function, and this is just a plain-old-ordinary complex-analyt
ic function and conventional 19th century math handles this just fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there's an infinite number of points in space, so you have to
 multiply the above by infinity.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solution for this is not to count points but to use measure theory.
 There's actually some formal mathematically-rigorous ways of doing this;
 one I've tripped across is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract Weiner space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is pretty cool.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wiener_space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other ways of making some amount of mathematically-rigorous forward
 progress within this conventional QFT framework.
 They don't go all the way.
 The other alternative is to throw up your hands and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

screw it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and use string theory, in which you can explicitly show that these kinds
 of sums are explicitly finite, using completely unrelated mechanisms.
 But then you get the string swampland.
 At any rate, we're totally off-topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the main topic: for an airplane wing, or for a vibrating drum
 (instead of a guitar string) one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}=n+\mathcal{O}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 but you have 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 of these (for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perfectly round wing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aka a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spherical cow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and so now your right-most pole is at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1$
\end_inset

 and maybe more poles in other locations, and for a spherical radar cavity,
 the modes are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\left(\ell+1\right)$
\end_inset

 degenerate so you get a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2$
\end_inset

 and maybe more poles in other places, and so on down the line: a pole at
 
\begin_inset Formula $s=D-1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 dimensions.
 All this is more-or-less 19th century complex analysis, with no particular
 magic.
 Except for the spectrum, it's not physics; the sums are just classical
 sums.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already noted, the exponential regulator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{t}=\sum_{n}\omega_{n}\exp-t\left|\omega_{n}\right|
\]

\end_inset

and as you already know, this can be related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle H\right\rangle _{s}$
\end_inset

 with the Laplace transform & Mellin transform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gaussian regulator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle H\right\rangle _{gt}=\sum_{n}\omega_{n}\exp-t^{2}\left|\omega_{n}\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

and I'm not sure how to relate this to the other regulators, but again,
 the place to look is not physics books, cause this is not physics, but
 instead books on complex analysis.
 In my experience, books from the late 19th and early 20th century are better
 places to look for obscure stuff like this, because the modern texts have
 decided that the obscure stuff is boring and they skip it in favor of modern
 developments.
 And honestly, the obscure stuff really is mind-numbingly dull, unless you
 actually need to actually have some specific obscure formula, in which
 case it's fascinating.
 So I'm thinking, for example, the Hardy&Littlewood (or is it Hardy & Wright?)
 book from 1921, which is filled with mathematical gems on complex analysis
 that you'll never find in modern texts, and which will also drain from
 your mind as soon as you turn the page.
 Frack, I can't even remember the names of the authors of some of the things
 I've seen.
 In short, I've seen this stuff, but I haven't memorized it, so I can't
 tell you what it is.
 Sorry, I have to say
