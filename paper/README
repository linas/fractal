Contents:

In quasi-historical order:

overview:
    Basic intro to binary tree phenomena. Mostly made obsolete by
    minkowski, below, and other bits & pieces.

transfer:
   2005 -- early draft of above...

minkowski:
   THE MINKOWSKI QUESTION MARK,
   PSL(2, Z) AND THE MODULAR GROUP
   (EXPOSITORY)

bernoulli:
   The Bernoulli operator exhaustive treatment.
   Incluces the Ising tartan, the lattice modeles, the push-forward

dedekind:
   Mandelbrot set as a Modular Form

fdist:
   clip-book of partial results on MODULAR FRACTAL MEASURES

frac-zeta:

gap:

gkw:
    Sawtooth eignevalues and many other results.

mink-exact:
    Exact results on the Minkowski measure.

flajolet:
    Paper with Philippe Flajolet

hurwitz:
    The polylogarithm paper.

de_Rham:
    lots of de_Rham curves

beta:
    Tent map and multiplication operator transfer operator
    Properly the Beta-transformation.  solvit.lyx is a diary,
    beta-spectrum.lyx is cleaned up and submitted forr publication.

beta-expand:
	Beta-expansion of the beta-shift. Being prepared for publication.

beta-measure:
   Bernoulli and beta measure with p != 1/2. Barely even started.

redheffer:
    A variant of the Redheffer matrix (or rather, related to it).
    The spectrum of the Redheffer matrix is *any* completely
    multiplicative series! (including the Riemann zeta). The rows
    are the divisor function; the columns total to the Euler totient.

yarh-two:
    Exploration of zeros of totally multiplicative sequences.

sciclub/fiber:
    Lecture notes for science club.

========================================================
unpublished:

quantum:
    Physics and general relativity.

category:
    Diary about category theory, model theory, proof theory, modal
    logic.

duplex:
    Duplex category (like the simplex, but for pairs)

entropy:
    Entropy of continued fractions (gkw entropy)

fool:
    Dec 2014 A foolish proof of RH.  This is the good one,
    Needs cleanup and publishing!

frontal:
    Hilbert-Polya Berry-Keating conjecture.

gravit: (2018)
    Gravitational coupling of driven oscillators.

gpf:
	Greatest Prime Factor

sciclub/crypto: outline for talk

quaternion:
	Bernoulli x-form for quaternions

periodic-zeta:
	All things periodic-zeta-related

odometers:
	Diary of odometer things

skyrme-qcd:
	Confusions and elucidations of the sigma model.

clock-shift:
	Measure-preserving dynamical systems. With a clock.

cpt-symmetry:
	Mostly about Majorana ... and charge conjugation.

mcculloch:
	Quantized black body radiation.

gr-entropy: (May 2023)
	Ergodicity and Entropy for Black Holes: Part One
	Part Three contains flashlights basic work.
	Part Five contains more flashlight work.

meredith: (October 2023)
	Private correspondance.

polylog: (October 2023)
	The Polylog and the Riemann Hypothesis. Short note about the polylog
   animations at https://linas.org/art-gallery/polylog/polylog.html

circle-metric: (November 2023)
	Review and general exploration of the circle map.

vitali: (November 2023)
   A review of the Vitali set, presented two ways: first, generic but
   informal, and second, precise, as explict construction on the
   eventually-periodic orbits of the Bernoulli shift acting on Cantor
   space. The second form allows significant focus to be placed on the
   axiom of choice.

   Finished, final draft of this published on personal website.
   PDF, 15 pages, all text, no images.  Not sophisticated enough for
   formal publication; its an extended homework problem solution.

borel: (December 2023)
   Exploration of the Borel hierarchy for the Cantor space.

reading-review: (March 2024)
   TODO-list of things that should be read.

wave-collapse: (April 2024)
   There may actually be a way of formally deriving wave-function
   collapse in a many-body system, analogous (perhaps?) to sand-pile
   collapse at criticality. Preliminary diary. No results, yet.

complexity: (January 2025)
   Explore combinatorial syntax.


========================================================
Obsolete and/or stale:

measure:
    2004, 2 pages, Pascal's triangle as a fractal Sierpinski gasket.
    Very short.  Nothing to salvage, here.

rotations:
    2004, 7 pages, hyperbolic rotations on cantor set.
    chap-minkowski.pdf covers rotations in a more general fashion.

lattice:
    2006: lattice models and fractal measures
    Mostly supplanted by mink-exact, which actually solves
    the lattice mode.  Includes the Ising model tartan picture
    (which now appears in the bernoulli.pdf paper.)

pushforward:
    2008 draft of transfer operator as the measure-theoretic
    push-forward. Half-baked.  A more modern variant is in mink-exact
    Also a variant is in the bernoulli.pdf paper.

berry:
    Oct 2008 draft Berry conjecture. very confusing. What's the point???

gkw-lattice:
    2010 Short 2-pages confusion about similarity of GKW under
    question mark. Incomplete

conversion from cvs to git 21 November 2014:

cvs2git --dry-run   /home/linas/cvsroot

git init  --bare
git fast-import --export-marks=../marky < ../blobby

NO DON'T DO THIS its slow:
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf xacc' HEAD

YES DO THIS: its fast:
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter fractal master
