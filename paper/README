Contents:

In quasi-historical order:

overview:
    Basic intro to binary tree phenomena. Mostly made obsolete by
    minkowski, below, and other bits & pieces.

transfer:
   2005 -- early draft of above...

minkowski:
   THE MINKOWSKI QUESTION MARK,
   PSL(2, Z) AND THE MODULAR GROUP
   (EXPOSITORY)

bernoulli:
   The Bernoulli operator exhaustive treatment.
   Incluces the Ising tartan, the lattice modeles, the push-forward

dedekind:
   Mandelbrot set as a Modular Form

fdist:
   clip-book of partial results on MODULAR FRACTAL MEASURES

frac-zeta:

gap:

gkw:
    Sawtooth eignevalues and many other results.


mink-exact:
    Exact results on the Minkowski measure.

flajolet:

hurwitz:
	The polylogarithm paper.

de_Rham:
    lots of de_Rham curves

quantum:
    Physics and general relativity.

beta:
    Tent map and multiplication operator transfer operator
    Properly the Beta-transformation.  solvit.lyx is a diary,
    beta-spectrum.lyx is cleaned up and submitted forr publication.

beta-expand:
	Beta-expansion of the beta-shift. Being prepared for publication.

beta-measure:
   Bernoulli and beta measure with p != 1/2. Barely even started.

redheffer:
    A variant of the Redheffer matrix (or rather, related to it).
    The spectrum of the Redheffer matrix is *any* completely
    multiplicative series! (including the Riemann zeta). The rows
    are the divisor function; the columns total to the Euler totient.

yarh-two:
    Exploration of zeros of totally multiplicative sequences.

fiber:
    Lecture notes for science club.

========================================================
unpublished:

category:
    Diary about category theory, model theory, proof theory, modal
    logic.

duplex:
    Duplex category (like the simplex, but for pairs)

entropy: 
    Entropy of continued fractions (gkw entropy)

fool:
    Dec 2014 A foolish proof of RH.  This is the good one, 
    Needs cleanup and publishing!

frontal:
    Hilbert-Polya Berry-Keating conjecture.

gravit:
    Gravitational coupling of driven oscillators.

gpf:
	Greatest Prime Factor

crypto: outline for talk

quaternion:
	Bernoulli x-form for quaternions

periodic-zeta:
	All things periodic-zeta-related

odometers:
	Diary of odometer things

skyrme-qcd:
	Confusions and eluciations of the sigma model.

clock-shift:
	Measure-preserving dynamical systems. With a clock.

========================================================
Obsolete and/or stale:

measure:
    2004, 2 pages, Pascal's triangle as a fractal Sierpinski gasket.
    Very short.  Nothing to salvage, here.

rotations:
    2004, 7 pages, hyperbolic rotations on cantor set. 
    chap-minkowski.pdf covers rotations in a more general fashion.

lattice:
    2006: lattice models and fractal measures
    Mostly supplanted by mink-exact, which actually solves
    the lattice mode.  Includes the Ising model tartan picture
    (which now appears in the bernoulli.pdf paper.)

pushforward:
    2008 draft of transfer operator as the measure-theoretic
    push-forward. Half-baked.  A more modern variant is in mink-exact
    Also a variant is in the bernoulli.pdf paper.

berry:
    Oct 2008 draft Berry conjecture. very confusing. What's the point???

gkw-lattice:
    2010 Short 2-pages confusion about similarity of GKW under
    question mark. Incomplete

conversion from cvs to git 21 November 2014:

cvs2git --dry-run   /home/linas/cvsroot
cvs2git --blobfile blobby --dumpfile dumpy --username=linas /home/linas/cvsroot


git init  --bare
git fast-import --export-marks=../marky < ../blobby
git fast-import --import-marks=../marky < ../dumpy


NO DON"T DO THIS its slow:
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf xacc' HEAD  

YES DO THIS: its fast:
git filter-branch --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter fractal master

mv /home/linas/cvsroot ~/archive/backlot/cvs-2014-11-21/cvsroot
mv converted git to ~/archive/backlot/git-2014-11-21
