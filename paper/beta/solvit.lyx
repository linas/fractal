\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transformation is the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\,\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 The special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable.
 The Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)
 behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The Cantor space consists of infinite strings of binary digits; it is notable
 for many properties, including that it can represent the real number line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the unit interval,
 it singles out a subspace of the Cantor space that is invariant under the
 action of the left-shift operator.
 That is, lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transform seems to capture something basic about the multiplication
 of two real numbers: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 It offers insight into the nature of multiplication.
 Iterating on multiplication, one would get 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{n}x$
\end_inset

 â€“ that is, exponentiation; the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this
 in strange ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Analyzing the beta transform is difficult.
 The work presented here is more-or-less a research diary: a pastiche of
 observations and some shallow insights.
 One is that chaos seems to be rooted in how the carry bit behaves during
 multiplication.
 Another is that one can surgically insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into chaotic (ergodic) systems, and have some fair amount of control over
 how those islands of stability behave.
 One can have islands with, or without a period-doubling 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

route to chaos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The eigenvalues of the transfer operator seem to lie on a circle of radius
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane.
 Given that the transfer operator is purely real, the appearance of such
 a quasi-unitary spectrum unexpected.
 The spectrum appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic
 polynomials, the positive real roots of which include the Golden and silver
 ratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonacci (tribonacci, tetranacci, etc.)
 numbers.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last three or four decades of mathematical research has seen dramatic
 advances in the theory of subshifts.
 This text is mostly not about that, except to point out that this theory
 has very broad and important impact on many branches of physics and mathematics.
 From the perspective of the amateur enthusiast, the theory of subshifts
 finally exposes and makes clear some of the mysterious and intriguing behavior
 of fractals and of chaotic dynamical systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text focuses almost entirely on just one particular map of the unit
 interval, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform, defined as the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 As such, it is an example of an iterated map on the unit interval of the
 real number line.
 Such maps have the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f:[0,1]\to[0,1]
\]

\end_inset

and the topic is the exploration of the consequence of iterating the map
 by composing: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f^{n}(x)=(f\circ f\circ\cdots\circ f)(x)=f(f(\cdots f(x)\cdots))
\]

\end_inset

Such one-dimensional iterated maps have been heavily studied, and there
 is a large body of results, interconnecting many different concepts and
 results from mathematics, and so having a particularly broad range.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text attempts to report some brand-new results on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.
 This is perhaps surprising, as one might think that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform is sufficiently simple so as to be well-studied and well-understood,
 it being among the very simplest of iterated one-dimensional maps.
 This text also attempts to report these results in a naive and unsophisticated
 fashion, in the hope that this makes the text readable for the interested
 student and casual enthusiast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, although the author is personally excited by the advances in the field,
 this text is neither a survey of known results on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform, nor does it much glance at most of the typical avenues that
 are available for studying one-dimensional maps.
 This text does focus extensively on the spectrum of the transfer operator
 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle Perron Frobenius operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and thus it contributes to the general 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Koopmania
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Little prior knowledge is assumed, and the needed concepts are introduced
 in a very casual and informal way.
 This will, no doubt, completely discourage and dismay the formally trained
 mathematician.
 The best I can offer is to reiterate: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new results
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, off the beaten track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text begins with some pretty pictures, showing the iterated tent and
 logistic maps, so as to remind the reader as to why this is an interesting
 problem to study.
 The fact is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation is far more dry and abstract than the rather sexy logistic
 map, or its complex cousin, the Mandelbrot set.
 The hope is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation is also simpler, and therefore, perhaps, easier to understand.
 The reader will soon discover that there is nothing particularly easy about
 it, and that, at every turn, one bumps into other interesting areas of
 mathematics that could, perhaps should shed some light, but don't actually
 seem to do so, in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most fun for the casual reader might be chapter 5, on the periodic orbits,
 where the quasi-cyclotomic polynomials appear; these are polynomials of
 the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 being binary bits (zero or one).
 Also quite fun is the section on the islands of stability, which sheds
 light on how one can take a purely ergodic (chaotic) system, and surgically
 insert, as desired, islands of stability.
 The point here is that the classic logistic map attracted interest precisely
 because of its interleaving of chaos and stability; it turns out, one can
 manufacture such systems, at will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A word about the format of this paper: this is a 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

research diary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not a formal report.
 This, it contains various unfinished corners, maybe some errors, and notes-to-s
elf.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bernoulli shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift (
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 the bit-shift map, the dyadic transform or the full shift)is an iterated
 map on the unit interval, given by iteration of the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b(x)=\begin{cases}
2x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2x-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:Bernoulli shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbolic dynamics of this map gives the binary digit expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b^{n}(x)=(b\circ b\circ\cdots\circ b)(x)=b(b(\cdots b(x)\cdots))
\]

\end_inset

to denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold iteration of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{0}(x)=x$
\end_inset

.
 The symbolic dynamics is given by the bit-sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le b^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le b^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:bernoulli-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(Caution: 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is a subscript on the left, and a superscript on the right! The left is
 a sequence, the right is an iteration.
 Using the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 one both sides is a convenient abuse of notation.) Of course, the symbolic
 dynamics recreates the initial real number:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}\left(x\right)2^{-n-1}\label{eq:homomorphism}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

All of this is just a fancy way of saying that a real number can be written
 in terms of it's base-2 binary expansion.
 That is, the binary digits for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=b_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift has many interesting properties, connecting it to the
 Cantor set and a large class of self-similar fractals.
 It is also connected to the modular group and elliptic functions (thence
 to number theory).
 It is also the primary example of an ergodic system, and, in a sense, has
 far-reaching implications for ergodic systems via Ornstein theory.
 These various connections are far too numerous to review here, beyond these
 breif mentions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current task is to attempt to see how many of these properties still
 hold in the more general case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shift space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here deserves a small bit of formality.
 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be formally defined to be a set of infinite sequences of a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 letters (or symbols), together with a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that takes each sequence, and lops off the left-most symbol.
 For the Bernoulli shift, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 letters, taken from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For the Bernoulli shift, one is typically interested in the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 possible infinite sequences: this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for this shift space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 denoting countable infinity.
 For the Bernoulli shift, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator: it just lops of the left-most symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a shift space does not have to include every possible sequence
 of symbols; it does, however, by definition, have to be shift-invariant.
 That is, given some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of infinite sequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift space if and only if, by loping off the leading symbol of each
 string, one regains 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 In formulas, a shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 must obey 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
TS=S
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 000\cdots,111\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 contains only two elements: the string of all zeros, and the string of
 all ones; loping off the leading digit just returns 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 In general, shift spaces may contain a finite, or a countable, or an uncountabl
e number of elements.
 In general, one defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the space 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 of all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols.
 Subsets that are shift spaces are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subshifts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also deserve some mention: given one specific sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in S$
\end_inset

 out of the shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, one can ponder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where it goes to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as one lops off a symbol at a time.
 This gives the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orbit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ T^{m}x\,|\,\mbox{integer }m\ge0\right\} $
\end_inset

 â€“ that is, the set of all places that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 goes to.
 There are several possibilities: one is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Tx=x$
\end_inset

.
 Another is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a repeating sequence of symbols, in which case iteration repeats as
 well: 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}x=x$
\end_inset

 holds whenever the repeat length is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

; this is a periodic orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, when there are non-periodic orbits, then there are uncountaly
 many of them.
 That is, the number of periodic orbits is always countable: ther are at
 most 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 starting points for an orbit, and they are of at most length 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This includes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eventually periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 orbits: those that begin with some finite intial sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moves, eventually settling into a periodic recurrance.
 This cannot be done for the non-periodic orbits: they cannot be placed
 in lexicographic order; as the Cantor slash argument applies.
 The non-periodic orbits are always uncountable.
 In this sense, the non-periodic orbits are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more important
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that the make up the bulk of all orbits.
 There are situations in which the periodic orbits can be said to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

govern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the dynamics of the aperiodic ones; this is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However such concepts are advanced, and are not obviously applicable to
 the current situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows, the text will in general confine itself to the uncountable
 case.
 Periodic orbits exist, but will be ignored; in a certain strict sense,
 they constitute a set of measure zero.
 A number of glosses like this will be made: for example, the real numbers,
 and the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 are both uncountable; however, they are not in one-to-one correspondence,
 as some real numbers can have two different representations as bit sequences.
 Specifically, these are the fractions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2n+1\right)/2^{m}$
\end_inset

 for positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 â€“ they can be validly represented by bit-sequences ending in all-zeros,
 or all-ones.
 There are countably many such fractions, termed the dyadic fractions.
 For the most part, this difference between the real number line, and the
 Cantor space will be ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift is similar to the Bernoulli shift, replacing the number 2
 by a constant real-number value 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 It can be defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:downshift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This map, together with similar maps, is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Iterated-piece-wise-linear"

\end_inset

 below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the Bernoulli shift generates a sequence of digits, so does the
 beta shift: write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{n}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:down-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the symbolic dynamics, one can reconstruct the original value whenever
 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{k_{0}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Written this way, the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 clearly acts as a shift on this sequence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{4}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

In this sense, this shift is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exactly solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the above provides a closed-form solution for iterating and un-iterating
 the sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying out the above sequence, one obtains the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, namely the series
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\label{eq:shift series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the bit-sequence that was extracted by iteration can be used to
 reconstruct the original real number.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:down-bits"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 gives the Bernoulli shift.
 Explicitly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}\left(x\right)=b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the Bernoulli shift, not every possible bit-sequence occurs in this
 system.
 It is a subshift of the full shift: it is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 This is explored in greater detail in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Associated polynomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iterated shift can also be written as a finite sum.
 This is noted here; it will be useful in later sections.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\beta\left(x-\frac{k_{0}}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{2}(x)=\beta^{2}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta k_{0}+k_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{3}(x)=\beta^{3}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta^{2}k_{0}+\beta k_{1}+k_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The general form is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{p}(x)=\beta^{p}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}k_{m}\beta^{p-m-1}\label{eq:iterated shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{m}$
\end_inset

 depend on both 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, this is not a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 polynomial; however, it will be useful in analysis, later.

The

long-term dynamics

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Scare quotes are used, as these are imprecise terms; greater precision
 will be provided shortly.
 The idea of a bifurcation diagram was made famous by the Feigenbaum map
 (shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

), and so the same idea is applied here: track orbits over long periods
 of time, and see where they go.
 This forms a density, which can be numerically explored by historgramming.

Formal mathematics distinguishes between many different kinds of chaotic
 number sequences: those that are ergodic, those that are weakly or strongly
 Bernoulli, weakly or strongly mixing.
 The beta transform is known to be ergodic,

 popping up intermittently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visualization of the long-term dynamics is done by generating a histogram,
 and then taking the limit, as follows.
 One divides the unit interval into a fixed sequence of equal-sized bins;
 say a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins, so that each is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 in width.
 Pick a starting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and then iterate: if, at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th iteration, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $j/N\le b_{\beta}^{n}(x)<(j+1)/N$
\end_inset

, then increment the count for the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 After a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 iterations, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c(j;M)$
\end_inset

 be the count in the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 This count is the histogram.
 In the limit of a large number of iterations, as well as small bin sizes,
 one obtains a distribution: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y;x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\lim_{M\to\infty}\frac{c(j;M)}{M}\mbox{ for }\frac{j}{N}\le y<\frac{j+1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

This distribution depends on the initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 chosen for the point to be iterated; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution results when one averages over all starting points:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(y;x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset

Numerically, this integration can be achieved by randomly sampling a large
 number of starting points.
 Observe, by definition, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 is a probability distribution:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset

Probability distributions are the same thing as measures; they assign a
 density to each point on the unit interval.
 It can be shown that this particular distribution is invariant under iteration,
 and thus is often called the invariant measure, or sometimes the Haar measure.

Logistic Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logistic map is related to the tent map, and is given by iteration of
 the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}\left(x\right)=2\beta x(1-x)
\]

\end_inset

It essentially replaces the triangle forming the tent map with a parabola
 of the same height.
 That is, the function is defined here so that the the same value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the same height for all three maps.
 Although the heights of the iterators have been aligned so that they match,
 each exhibits rather dramatically different dynamics.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform has a single fixed point for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

, and then explodes into a fully chaotic regime above that.
 By contrast, the logistic map maintains a single fixed point up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3/2$
\end_inset

, where it famously starts a series of period-doubling bifurcations.
 The onset of chaos is where the bifurcations come to a limit, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3.56995/2=1.784975$
\end_inset

.
 Within this chaotic region are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which do not appear in either the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform, or in the tent map.
 The tent map does show a period-doubling regime, but in this region, there
 are no fixed points: rather, the motion is chaotic, but confined to multiple
 arms.
 At any rate, the period doubling occurs at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 than for the logistic map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bifurcation diagram is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 Again, it is worth closely examining the similarities between this, and
 the corresponding tent-map diagram, as well as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform diagram.
 Naively, it would seem that the general structure of the chaotic regions
 are shared by all three maps.
 Thus, in order to understand chaos in the logistic map, it is perhaps easier
 to study it in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.

 among these three illustrations.
 Formalizing this similarity is a bit harder, but it can be done: there
 is a way to make all three of these maps be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topologically conjugate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to one-another.
 This is perhaps surprising to some readers, but is based on the observation
 that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the logistic map are countable, and are in one-to-one correspondence
 with certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the iterated beta transformation.
 These are in turn in one-to-one correspondence with rational numbers.
 With a slight distortion of the beta transformation, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 can be mapped to the islands of stability, in essentially the same way

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After exactly one iteration of the beta shift, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and never leave.
 Likewise, the range of the iterated beta-shift is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, an alternative representation of the beta shift, filling the entire
 unit square, can be obtained by dividing both the domain and range by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

 to obtain the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
\beta u-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:beta transform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be written more compactly as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the function is known as the beta-transform, and is often
 called the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation, presenting a typesetting challenge to search engines when
 used in titles of papers.
 The orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the beta-shift is identical to the orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $u=2x/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the beta-transformation.
 Explicitly comparing to the beta-shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}t_{\beta}^{n}\left(\frac{2x}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:xform-shift equivalence}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The beta-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation are essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; this text works almost exclusively with the beta-shift, and is thus idiosyncra
tic, as it flouts the more common convention of working with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The primary reason for doing this is to retain contact with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift being a subshift of the full shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a single iteration of the tent map, a similar situation applies.
 After one iteration, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 After a finite number of iterations, all points 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x\le\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 are swept up, so that the remaining iteration takes place on the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)<x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 It is worth defining a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sidetent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function, which corresponds to the that part of the tent map in which iteration
 is confined.
 It is nothing more than a rescaling of the tent map, ignoring those parts
 outside of the above domain that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wander away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The sidetent is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta\left(u-1\right)+2 & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\\
\beta\left(1-u\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Performing a left-right flip on the side-tent brings it closer in form to
 the beta-transformation.
 The flipped version, replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $u\to1-u$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
2-\beta u & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tent map (and the flipped tent) exhibits fixed points (periodic orbits;
 mode-locking) for the smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 These can be eliminated by shifting part of the tent downwards, so that
 the diagonal is never intersected.
 This suggests the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula

The beta shift map, shown in the upper left, generates orbits that spend
 all of their time in the shaded area: a box of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{2}\times\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Enlarging this box to the unit square gives the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The tent map resembles the beta shift, except that one arm is flipped to
 make a tent-shape.
 After a finite number of iterations, orbits move entirely in the shaded
 region; enlarging this region to be the unit square gives the sidetent
 map.
 Flipping it left-right gives the fliptent map.
 Although it is not trivially obvious, the fliptent map and the sidetent
 map have the same orbits, and thus the same bifurcation diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset space \qquad{}
\end_inset

The bottom three maps all have fixed points and periodic orbits, essentially
 because the diagonal intersects the map.
 The top three maps have no periodic orbits, and are purely chaotic, essentially
 because the diagonal does not intersect them.
 Note tht the slopes and the geometric proportions of all six maps are identical
; they are merely rearrangents of the same basic elements.

\begin_layout Standard
A brief review of dynamical systems is in order, as it provides a coherent
 language with which to talk about and think about the beta-shift.
 The technical reason for this is that a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 provides a more natural setting for the theory, and that a lot of the confusion
 about what happens on the unit interval is intimately entangled with the
 homomorphism 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shift series"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as the case may be).
 Disentangling the subshift from the homomorphism provides a clearer insight
 into what phenomena are due to which component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The review of dynamical systems here is more-or-less textbook-standard material;
 it is included here only to provide a firm grounding for later discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be given a topology, the product topology.
 The open sets of this topology are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the infinite strings in three symbols: a finite number of 0 and
 1 symbols, and an infinite number of * symbols, the latter meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Set union is defined location-by-location, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cup*=1\cup*=*$
\end_inset

 and set intersection as 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cap*=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cap*=1$
\end_inset

.
 Set complement exchanges 0 and 1 and leaves * alone: 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{*}=*$
\end_inset

.
 The topology is then the collection of all cylinder sets.
 Note that the intersection of any finite number of cylinder sets is still
 a cylinder set, as is the union of an infinite number of them.
 The product topology does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 contain any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: strings consisting solely of just 0 and 1 are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 allowed in the topology.
 By definition, topologies only allow finite intersections, and thus don't
 provide any way of constructing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, points can always be added 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but doing so tends to generate a topology (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

box toplogy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too fine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; in particular, the common-sense notions of a continuous function are ruined
 by fine topologies.
 The product topology is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coarse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Borel algebra, or sigma-algebra, takes the topology and also allows
 set complement.
 This effectively changes nothing, as the open sets are still the cylinder
 sets, although now they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clopen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as they are both closed and open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote the Borel algebra by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A shift is now a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set.
 This is provides strong theoretical advantages over working with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: confusions about counting points and orbits and defining densities go
 away.
 This is done by recasting discussion in terms of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 from Borel sets to the reals (or the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or other fields, when this is interesting).
 An important class of such functions are the measures.
 These are functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 that are positive, and are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the sigma algebra, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cup B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)+\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 and (for product-space measures) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cap B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The measure of the total space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is by convention unity: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototypical example of a measure is the Bernoulli measure, which assigns
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to any string containing a single 0 and the rest all *'s.
 By complement, a string containing a single 1 and the rest all *'s has
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

.
 The rest follows from the sigma algebra: a cylinder set consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 ones has measure 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{m}\left(1-p\right)^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually convenient to take 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fair coin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the Bernoulli process is a sequence of coin tosses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is a homomorphism from the Cantor space to the unit interval.
 It extends naturally to a map from the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 to the algebra of intervals on the unit interval.
 It is not an isomorphism: cylinder sets are both open and closed, whereas
 intervals on the real number line are either open, or closed (or half-open).
 It is convenient to take the map as a map to closed intervals, so that
 it's a surjection onto the reals, although usually, this detail does not
 matter.
 What does matter is if one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, then the Bernoulli measure is preserved: it is mapped onto the conventional
 measure on the real-number line.
 Thus, the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $0***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/2\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1/2,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and both have a measure of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 and this extends likewise to all intersections and unions.
 Points have a measure of zero.
 That is, the homomorphism 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 preserves the fair-coin Bernoulli measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the map of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is not an isomorphism, it is more-or-less safe for most practical purposes
 to treat it as such.
 For any closed interval, there is a unique corresponding cylinder set.
 The only trouble arises at at a countable number of points: all dyadic
 rationals have two expansions, not one, and so there, the map is not invertable.
 However, the points all have a measure of zero in both cases, and there
 are only a countable number of such points, and the mapping always takes
 points to points.
 Thus, the inverse exists for almost all members of the algebra and is unique
 whenever an interval has positive measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of what is said above still holds for subshifts.
 Recall, a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 inherits a topology from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

; this is the subspace topology.
 The Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 is similarly defined, as are measures.
 One can now (finally!) give a precise definition for an invariant measure:
 it is a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\circ T^{-1}=\mu$
\end_inset

, or more precisely, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(T^{-1}\left(\sigma\right)\right)=\mu\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all cylinder sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in S$
\end_inset

.
 This is what shift invariance looks like.
 Note carefully that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is used in the definition.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a surjection while 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not: every cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in the subshift 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

came from somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; we want to define invariance for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and not just for some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is technically called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pushforward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it defines a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 It is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obviously linear, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(af+bg\right)=a\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(f\right)+b\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This pushforward is canonically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Like any linear operator, it has a spectrum.
 The precise spectrum depends on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical example is again the Bernoulli shift.
 For this, we invoke the inverse of the mapping of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a function defined on the unit interval, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is the space of real-analytic functions on the unit interval, that is,
 the closure of the space of all polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, then the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is discrete.
 It consists of the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to an eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}B_{n}=2^{-n}B_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 is the invariant measure on the full shift.
 For the space of square-integrable functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and consists of the unit disk in the complex plane; the
 corresponding eigenfunctions are fractal.
 Even more interesting constructions are possible; the Minkowski question
 mark function provides an example of a measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift defined by the Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)\mapsto\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 That is, as a measure, it solves 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 the Minkowski question mark function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 it's derivative; note that the derivative is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This rather confusing idea (of something being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) can be completely dispelled by observing that it is well-defined on all
 cylinder sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and is finite on all of them â€“ not only finite, but less than one, as any
 good measure must obey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These last examples are mentioned so as to reinforce the idea that working
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 instead of the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$

 really does offer some strong conceptual advantages.
 They also reinforce the idea that the Bernoulli shift is not the only

Combining the above gives an alternate defintion for an SFT.
 A subshift is of finite type if there exists directed graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 having 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 vertices, such that the only transitions between successive digits in the
 subshift correspond to edges in the graph.
 That is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

 having a digit expansion 
\begin_inset Formula $\cdots d_{k-1}d_{k}d_{k+1}\cdots$
\end_inset

 the only digit transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k}d_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 are those that correspond to a (directed) edge in the graph.
 Every such graph has a corresponding

\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}=1$

A breif review of the Cantor set is in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift corresponds to the sequence of binary digits of a real
 number.
 Such sequences can be imagined to belong to the space of all possible sequences
 of binary digits, the Cartesian product of infinitely many copies of the
 set containing two elements:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ 0,1\right\} \times\left\{ 0,1\right\} \times\left\{ 0,1\right\} \times\cdots=\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}=2^{\omega}

\end_inset

This set is the Cantor set.
 It has a natural topology, the product topology, whose open sets are finite
 lengths of digits, possibly interspersed with some

\end_inset

 provides a homomorphism from the Cantor set to the unit interval.
 There are other homorphisms into a broad variety of fractals.
 Essentially all of the strange phenomena of fractals and of iterated functions
 follows from the product topology on this sequence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The self-similarity of many kinds of fractals can be described with the
 Cantor set.
 This arises from the self-similarity of the product space under the action
 of a shift: specifically, the left-shift, which discards the left-most
 digit, and shifts the rest over by one.
 The shift operator itself is that operator that performs this shift; self-simil
ar fractals can be seen to be eigenstates of the shift operator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The infinitely-deep binary tree is another manifestation of the Cantor set.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 of the product space can be interpreted as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ L,R\right\} $
\end_inset

 of left-right moves.
 At each point in a binary sequence, one can make a choice of one of two
 things: to move left or right.
 This naturally suggests a binary decision tree.

\begin_layout Standard
A byproduct is the presence of some implicit, ambient hyperbolic space.
 The infinite binary tree, when drawn on flat two-dimensional space, simply
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, as each subsequent branching pushes closer together.
 The infinite binary tree can be embedded in the simplest hyperbolic space,
 the PoincarÃ© disk or upper-half-plane, in such a way that the distance,
 the spacing between two neighboring nodes is always the same.
 Visually, this takes the form of some prototypical M.C.
 Escher drawing, of a repeated fractal form moving out to the edge of a
 disk.

 That is, after an initial

 sequence, they settle down to a fixed point of period one.
 General rational numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$

 sequence, they settle down to periodic orbits of some fixed period.
 The bit-sequence becomes cyclic.
 This cyclic behavior implies that most of classical number theory can be
 dragged into the proceedings.
 Any particular statement that classical number theory makes with regard
 to rational numbers, or even modular forms, can be promptly ported over
 to a statement about the bit-sequences and the orbits of the Bernoulli
 shift, usually taking on a strange and unrecognizable form.

All of these things go together, like hand in glove: whenever one is manifest
 and visible, the others are lurking right nearby, in the unseen directions.
 All of these things can be given a formal and precise definition, and their
 explicit inter-relationships articulated.
 This has been done by a wide variety of authors over the last four decades;
 a proper bibliography would be overwhelming.
 I have written extensively on all of thee topics, trying to present them
 in the simplest, most jargon-free way that I can, in a dozen different
 texts available wherever you found this one.
 The ideas will not be repeated here; they are not immediately useful to
 the current proceedings.
 None-the-less, the general interplay between all of these concepts is extremely
 important to understand, and burbles constantly under the surface of the
 current proceedings.
 In essence, shifts and subshifts are interesting precisely because they
 touch on so any different topics; and, conversely, so many different areas
 of mathematics can inform the subshift.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that iteration can generate strings of binary digits, and that these
 can be reassembled back into real numbers, it is interesting to ask what
 those mappings look like.
 To firm up the notation, let 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\left(b_{n}\right)=\left(b_{0},b_{1,},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 denote a sequence of bits (or symbols) and write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{equation}
x_{\beta}\left(B\right)=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{b_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\label{eq:beta-expansion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

as the real number generated from that sequence.
 Conversely, given a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\left(k_{n;\beta}\left(x\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 denote the sequence of bits obtained by iterating the beta shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

; that is, the sequence generated by eqn.

 The bit sequence for 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}\left(x\right)$

 One is the compressor 
\begin_inset Formula

and the other is the expander
\begin_inset Formula

 associated with the two functions.
 For almost all

 total measure of the range of the compressor function is less than one.
 Likewise, for almost all

 This manifests itself as the gaps in the range of the compressor function,
 clearly visible in figure

 If a sequence of bits is viewed as a sequence of left-right moves walking
 down a binary tree, this implies that some branches of the tree are never
 taken, and can be pruned.
 Only branches on the right are ever pruned: That is, there can be arbitrarily
 long sequences of zeros in the expansion, but the longest possible sequence
 of 1's is always bounded.
 The longest run of 1's possible is the largest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 that satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2\ge\frac{1+\beta+\beta^{2}+\cdots\beta^{n-1}}{\beta^{n-1}}
\]

\end_inset

Solving, the bound is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n=1+\left\lfloor \frac{-\log\left(2-\beta\right)}{\log\beta}\right\rfloor \label{eq:longest-all-ones}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, every 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th right branch is pruned from the binary tree.

 Blue corresponds to a compression of the measure by about 1, green to a
 compression of about 2-3, and yellow-red to a compression greater than
 that.

Shifts with holes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viewed as a shift space, as opposed to a cut-down binary tree, the trimming
 can be thought of as a punching of holes into the full shift.
 This requires a bit of mental gymnastics.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 be an (open) interval on the real number line: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)=\left\{ x\,|\,a<x<c\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Given the Bernoulli shift 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(x\right)=T_{2}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 from eqns 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli shift"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

, consider the set
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)=\left\{ x\,|\,b^{n}\left(x\right)\notin\left(a,c\right)\mbox{ for any }n\ge0\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

That is, as one iterates on some fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, one requests that no iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 ever lands in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In essence, one has punched a hole in the unit interval; this corresponds
 to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hole
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the full Bernoulli shift.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 is what remains after punching such a hole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How can this be visualized? Considering the case 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

, its clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 cannot contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)\cap\left(a,c\right)=\emptyset$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 can come from one of two places: either from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a}{2},\frac{c}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 or from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a+1}{2},\frac{c+1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, and so neither of these can be in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

, the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a}{4},\frac{c}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a+1}{4},\frac{c+1}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a+2}{4},\frac{c+2}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{a+3}{4},\frac{c+3}{4}\right)$
\end_inset

 must also be gone.
 Continuing in this fashion, one proceeds with an infinite hole-punch: to
 obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

, one just cuts out 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 and everything that iterates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For the holes, write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)=\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigcup_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1}\left(\frac{a+k}{2^{n}},\frac{c+k}{2^{n}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and for the interval with the holes punched out: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)=\left[0,1\right]\backslash\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigcup$
\end_inset

 denotes set-union and 
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash$
\end_inset

 denotes set subtraction.
 It is not hard to see that, in the end, this forms a contorted Cantor set,
 using the standard midpoint-subtraction algorithm, but with different endpoints.
 The canonical Cantor set is built by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,c\right)=\left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 are subshifts: applying the left-shift to them just returns the same set
 again.
 Bot are invariant under the action of the shift operator.
 In formulas, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)=\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)=\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, for notational simplicity, the parenthesis are not written, so that
 for the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, write 
\begin_inset Formula $bS=b\left(S\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As shifts, its more appropriate to view both as sets of bit-sequences,
 so that the proper relationship between one and the other should have been
 written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)=\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}\backslash\mathcal{H}\left(a,c\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How should these subshifts be visualized as strings? Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b_{n}\left(x\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 be the bit sequence generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, for some 
\begin_inset Formula $a<x<c$
\end_inset

.
 The cut operation states that such strings can never occur anywhere in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Explicitly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(a,c\right)$
\end_inset

 never contains sequences of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}d_{1}d_{2}\cdots d_{k}b_{0}\left(x\right)b_{1}\left(x\right)b_{2}\left(x\right)\cdots$
\end_inset

 for any arbitrary leading bits 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}d_{1}d_{2}\cdots d_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How should these subshifts be visualized as binary trees? The simplest case
 to visualize is to take 
\begin_inset Formula $a=m/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\left(m+1\right)/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 being dyadic rationals, for some integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, one takes the bit-expansion for both have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 leading bits: one starts at the root of the tree, and walks down the binary
 tree, making left-right moves in accordance with this sequence, and after
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 moves, arrives at a node above a subtree.
 Just cut out this subtree, in it's entirety.
 That's the first cut.
 Now repeat the process, for the left and right subtrees, from off the root,
 
\emph on
ad infinitum
\emph default
.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 not dyadic rationals, the process is more complicated.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 are ordinary rationals, thus having a repeating bit-sequence, one performs
 in the same way, but cyclically walking down the side branches of subtrees.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 irrational, the algorithm is considerably more complicated, and is left
 as an exercise for the reader :-).

\begin_layout Subsection
Generalized compressors and expanders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range of the compressor function is a shift with a hole.
 Specifically, for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{I}\left(\frac{\beta}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The construction for shifts with holes can then be applied to construct
 generalized compressor and expander functions.
 One way, which is really rather cheesy, but it works, is to define the
 function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{dcpr}_{\beta,\gamma}\left(a;x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{\gamma^{n+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1}\delta\left(x-\frac{a+k}{\beta^{n}}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

and then define the generalized compressor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}\left(a;x\right)=\int_{0}^{x}\mbox{dcpr}\left(a;y\right)dy
\]

\end_inset

That is, as one walks along the unit interval, from left to right, one picks
 up points with weights on them, obtaining a generalized Devil's staircase
 (Cantor-Vitali) function.
 This generalization does not seem to be terribly useful here, and is left
 to rot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Self-similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subshifts are, by definition, self-similar.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subshift, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator, then 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

 is the key relation obeyed by a subshift.
 It is fun to see how this actually manifests itself on the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the two functions cpr and pdr are self-similar.
 The pdr function demonstrates classic period doubling self-similarity:
 namely, under 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)=x/2$
\end_inset

, it behaves as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

while under reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x)=1-x$
\end_inset

, it behaves as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ r\right)\left(x\right)=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(1-x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}-\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{x\to1}\,\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full dyadic monoid is generated by the generators 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 It consists of all finite-length strings of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma=g^{a_{1}}rg^{a_{2}}rg^{a_{3}}r\cdots rg^{a_{m}}
\]

\end_inset

for a finite-length list of positive integers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3,}\cdots,a_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this list can be interpreted as a continued fraction; this establishe
s an isomorphism between the continued fractions and the dyadic monoid.
 This isomorphism is conventionally called the Minkowski question-mark function.
 We can be a bit more explicit.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2\left(\beta-1\right)}-x
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\beta}\circ r_{\beta}=1$
\end_inset

 so that it is a reflection, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}\left(x\right)=1-x$
\end_inset

 is the reflection of the unit interval.
 For strings of binary digits, the reflection performs the exchange of 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leftrightarrow1$
\end_inset

; its a mirroring symmetry.
 The above relationships then become
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ g_{2}
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ r_{2}
\]

\end_inset

The symmetry under the dyadic monoid is simply the statement that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{\beta}\circ\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}=\mbox{pdr}_{\beta}\circ\gamma_{2}
\]

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of the above form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function cpr also exhibits self-similarity, although it alters (expands)
 what happens on the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis.
 Several self-similarities are apparent.
 First, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{\beta x}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Equivalently, for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le y\le\beta/2$
\end_inset

 one can trivially restate the above as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(y\right)\label{eq:compressor self-sim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Although this follows trivially, this restatement helps avoid certain confusions
 later in this text.
 This can also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{2}\circ\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}=\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\circ g_{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

There is obviously no corresponding reflection symmetry.
 The left and right halves are identical to one-another, but offset: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

It follows that

The cpr curve is just one that belongs to a class of such curves.
 As an example, one may construct a Takagi (blancmange) curve by iterating
 triangles whose peak is located at 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The Takagi curve is an example of a curve transforming under a 3-dimensional
 representation of the dyadic monoid; the cpr curves transforms under a
 two-dimensional representation.
 See my paper on the Takagi curve for details.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows such a curve.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

a curve constructed in this fashion.
 The transformation properties of this curve include self-similarity on
 the left, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)=x+w\;\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 and self-similarity on the right, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(\frac{1}{\beta}+x\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\right)=1-x+w\;\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Both of these properties follow directly from the construction of the curve;
 they can be taken as the defining equations for the curve.
 That is, the curve can be taken as that function which satisfies these
 two recursion relations.

The derivative of the skew Takagi curve is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, and, for lack of a better name, could be called the skew Haar fractal
 wavelet.
 It can be defined as the formal derivative
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{har}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)=\frac{d}{dx}\,\mbox{tak}_{\beta;w}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

This formal derivative is well-defined, as the skew Takagi is smooth and
 piecewise-linear almost everywhere; the places where it has corners is
 a dense set of measure zero.
 That is, the derivative is defined everywhere, except on a set of measure
 zero, which happens to be dense in the unit interval.

\begin_layout Section
Transfer operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discovery and study of invariant measures, as well as of decaying states
 can be approached via the transfer operator, or, properly named, the Ruelle-Fro
benius-Perron operator.
 This is an operator that captures the behavior of a distribution under
 the action of a map.
 The invariant measure is an eigenstate of this operator; indeed, it provides
 a formal definition for what it means to be invariant under the action
 of the map.
 The general theory for this was reviewed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Dynamical-Systems"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 We recap the defintion of the transfer operator in it's more limited sense,
 as a linear operator acting in a point-wise fashion, on the space of functions
 on the unit interval of the real number line.
 In the general setting, it is a pushforward.
 In the more limited setting, this pushforward nature of the map is a bit
 obscured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval, the transfer operator defines how distributions are
 acted on by this map.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x=g^{-1}(y)}\frac{f(x)}{\left|g^{\prime}(x)\right|}
\]

\end_inset

The left adjoint of the transfer operator is the composition operator (Koopman
 operator).
 This is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{C}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=f\left(g\left(y\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

The Koopman operator is adjoint, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}\mathcal{C}_{g}=1$
\end_inset

 but that, in general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{g}\mathcal{L}_{g}\ne1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform are only superficially different.
 We'll give both of them here, as it is sometimes useful to reference one
 or the other, depending on the situation.
 Superficially, they seem to have a different form, but are in the end just
 scaled versions of one-another.
 The transfer operator the beta-shift map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right] & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\beta/2\\
0 & \mbox{ for }\beta/2<y\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

or, written more compactly
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)\label{eq:xfer oper}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is the Heaviside step function.
 The transfer operator for the beta-transform map 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]

\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\rho\left(y\right)\label{eq:FP-eigenvector}

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}\nu_{\beta}\right]\left(y\right)=\nu_{\beta}\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{2}{\beta}\nu_{\beta}\left(\frac{2y}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)$
\end_inset

; the two invariant measures are just scaled copies of one-another.
 Both are normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\rho\left(y\right)dy=\int_{0}^{1}\nu_{\beta}\left(y\right)dy=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these invariant measures are the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron (RFP) eigenfunc
tions of the corresponding operators, as they correspond to the largest
 eigenvalues of the transfer operators, in each case being the eigenvalue
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, one is interested in characterizing the eigenspectrum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\lambda\rho\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

for eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|\le1$
\end_inset

 and eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

.
 Solving this equation requires choosing a space of functions in which to
 work.
 Natural choices include any of the Banach spaces, and in particular, the
 space of square-integrable functions.
 Particularly interesting is the space of almost-smooth functions, those
 having discontinuities at only a countable number of locations, but otherwise
 being infinitely differentiable.
 Although the discussion so far implicitly conditions one to restrict oneself
 to real-valued functions, and to consider only real-valued eigenvalues,
 this is perhaps too sharp a restriction.
 It will become clear in the following chapters that even the most basic
 form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has a complex-valued spectrum.
 At any rate, it should be obvious that, whatever the choice of function
 space, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<2y$
\end_inset

.
 This turns out to be a rather harsh condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least one basic fact is known: for at least some kinds of function spaces,
 the RFP eigenfunction is given by Gel'fond and Parry, as shown in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

.
 More precisely, it is just the rescaled form 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)=\nu\left(2x/\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 Changing vocabulary, this is sometimes called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; as it describes a measure on the unit interval.
 That is, for the space of all possible measures on the unit interval, the
 Gel'fond-Parry measure is one of the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator.
 Some caution is advised here: for the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, that is, the Bernoulli shift, one has as an eigenfunction the Minkowski
 measure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

; it has eigenvalue 1, but is otherwise quite pathological: it is continuous
 nowhere, zero on the rationals, and divergent on the rest (i.e.
 on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cantor set).
 There's no particular reason to think that this holds only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

; measures can be, in general, very unusual functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very minor simplification can be achieved with a change of variable.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Then the eigenequation becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda\beta\rho\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon\right)=\rho\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)+\rho\left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The second term vanishes whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<1-\epsilon/\beta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon<\beta(1-\beta/2)$
\end_inset

 and so one has the simpler recurrence relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\rho\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:eigen-branch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(\beta-1)<2y\le\beta$
\end_inset

 can be treated as recurrence relations, defining the

 eigenstate.
 Recursing on these gives exactly the densities shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Computationally, these are much, much cheaper to compute, at least for

(No) Real-analytic solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if we start with the assumption that there might be a real-analytic
 solution to the eigen-equation? It is reasonable to expect that this hope
 is doomed, but the process is instructive anyway.
 Start by positing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(y\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}y^{n}
\]

\end_inset

Ignoring, for a moment, the step function, and plugging this into the above
 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{y^{m}}{\beta^{m+1}}\left[a_{m}+\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left({m+j\atop m}\right)2^{-j}a_{m+j}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Matching, term by term, this gives the eigenequation 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda a_{m}=\sum_{k}L_{mk}a_{k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{mk}$
\end_inset

 an upper-triangular matrix, having matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{mk}=\frac{1}{\beta^{m+1}}\left[1+\frac{1}{2^{k-m}}\left({k\atop m}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ge m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{mk}=0$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Although this is upper-triangular, and thus solvable, the omission of the
 step function was critical: the eigenfunction has to vanish for 
\begin_inset Formula $y>\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and there is no way to do this with a real-analytic function.
 Inserting a step function into the mix ruins the term-by-term comparison.
 That is, positing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(y\right)=\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}y^{n}
\]

\end_inset

prevents the term-by-term comparison from passing through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps working with the beta-shift here is a bad idea.
 Let's try again with the beta-transform.
 Without ignoring the step function, and plugging through as before gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{y^{m}}{\beta^{m+1}}\left[a_{m}+\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left({m+j\atop m}\right)\beta^{-j}a_{m+j}\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

The step function prevents term-by-term comparison.
 If it is conveniently ignored or forgotten, then a pseudo-solution is easy:
 the trm-by-term solution gives the eigenequation 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda a_{m}=\sum_{k}M_{mk}a_{k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{mk}$
\end_inset

 an upper-triangular matrix, having matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{mk}=\frac{1}{\beta^{m+1}}\left[1+\frac{1}{\beta^{k-m}}\left({k\atop m}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ge m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{mk}=0$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 This matrix is solvable.
 Its solutions are effectively the Bernoulli polymonials.
 By ignoring the step function, all that has happened is that we've re-discovere
d the real-analytic solutions to the Bernoulli process; indeed, the term-by-term
 comparison does work for the special cse of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, when the step feunction really does disappear.

 These are most easily discussed by defining the operator

\]

\end_inset

Solving this operator is relatively straight-forward.
 Consider, for example, the monomial 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(y\right)=y^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}y^{n}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and that therefore, the space of polynomials is closed under the action
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 But this result is even stronger: the monomials provide a basis in which
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is upper-triangular,
\emph on
 i.e.

\emph default
 solvable.
 It's eigensolutions in this basis are polynomials.
 The eigenspectrum is clearly discrete, and is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\beta\right)^{-n-1}$
\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 corresponding to the degree of the polynomial eigensolution.

This all goes horribly wrong if one instead considers

 and the almost-monomials

\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\right]\left(y\right)= & \frac{1}{\beta}\left[\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\\
= & \frac{\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\left(y\right)}{\beta}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a non-polynomial, fractal eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, and, with a bit of elbow-grease, one can find many more.
 This includes the Takagi functions, and their higher-order analogs, which
 are, roughly speaking, Takagi functions constructed from polynomials.
 These all have interesting self-similarity properties under the dyadic
 monoid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\left(x\right)\ne0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<2x$
\end_inset

; it won't do as an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 There is no obvious, simple modification of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{ei}_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 that would cause it to be a valid eigensolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Manually installing a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)$
\end_inset

 and then iterating to find the closure leads to the same splatter of step
 functions as in the case of the polynomials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting case arises if one attempts a Fourier-inspired basis.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\left(x\right)=\exp\,i2\pi\left(2l+1\right)\beta^{n}x
\]

\end_inset

for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 One then obtains a shift sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\mbox{e}_{\beta;n-1;l}\left(x\right)\left(1+\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is not a viable candidate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, as it is again beset by the step function.
 As a shift sequence, it can be used to construct coherent states that are
 eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, having any eigenvalue within the unit disk.
 Specifically, observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{e}_{\beta;0;l}\left(1/2\right)=\exp i\pi\left(2l+1\right)=-1$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}\mbox{e}_{\beta;0;l}\right]\left(x\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and so the shift sequence terminates after finite iteration.
 Given a complex value 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, construct the coherent state as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{l;z}\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

The shift is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}\phi_{l;z}\right]\left(x\right)=\frac{z}{\beta}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{n}\left(1+\mbox{e}_{\beta;n+1;l}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is not particularly useful, until one notices that for for certain
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, this contains nilpotent sub-series.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, fix a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n=N$
\end_inset

 and consider those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{e}_{\beta;N;l}\left(1/2\right)=-1$
\end_inset

.
 This holds whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{N}$
\end_inset

 is an odd integer, that is, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\left(2m+1\right)^{1/N}$
\end_inset

 (and, as always, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\le2$
\end_inset

).
 For these special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{P}_{\beta}\mbox{e}_{\beta;N;l}\right]\left(x\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and so the functions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{l;z;N}\left(x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{N}z^{n}\mbox{e}_{\beta;n;l}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

vanish after 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 iterations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, these can be used to form a a basis in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is nilpotent.
 Conversely, letting 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 be free, the values for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\left(2m+1\right)^{1/N}$
\end_inset

 are dense in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and so any 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily close to one with a nilpotent function space.
 These values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are exactly the same values for which the bit sequences given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:down-bits"

\end_inset

 eventually terminate in all zeros; i.e.
 become periodic fixed points with period 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existence of a dense set of fixed points is dual to the the existence
 of nilpotent densities.
 That is, one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

causes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the other to happen.
 This idea should be further elaborated, as it establishes a duality between
 countable and uncountable sets, which has an element of curiosity to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presumably, there are special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 which allow a periodic orbits to originate from a dense set.
 Such values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, and such periodic orbits, should then correspond to specific self-similarities
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{l;z}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 function, specifically manifesting as cyclic behavior in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1+\mbox{e}_{\beta;n+1;l}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)^{p}$
\end_inset

 for some period 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Whether there is some similar manifestation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is wholly unclear; however, the examination of the periodic orbits of the
 beta shift, undertaken in a later chapter, will provide a strong clue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Complex eigenvalues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is purely real, then if it has a complex spectrum, the eigenvalues and
 eigenfunctions must come in complex-conjugate pairs.
 This can make numerical searches and numerical convergence behave in unexpected
 ways, so some brief commentary is in order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that there exists some complex-valued eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\lambda}\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 for fixed, complex eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Write it's real and complex components as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{\lambda}\left(w\right)=\sigma\left(w\right)+i\tau\left(w\right)
\]

\end_inset

while also writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=a+ib$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\sigma\right]\left(w\right)= & \frac{1}{2}\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\left(\rho_{\lambda}+\bar{\rho}_{\lambda}\right)\right]\left(w\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{2}\left(\lambda\rho_{\lambda}\left(w\right)+\bar{\lambda}\bar{\rho}_{\lambda}\left(w\right)\right)\\
= & a\sigma\left(w\right)-b\tau\left(w\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Both left and right sides of the above are real.
 If one had somehow stumbled upon 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 numerically, as an eigenvector-candidate, then the above admixing of the
 imaginary component would quickly throw one off the hunt.
 Thus, a numeric search for complex-valued eigenfunctions must necessarily
 take into account eigenfunction pairs, with real and imaginary components
 that mix together as above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consistency requires that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\tau\right]\left(w\right)= & \frac{1}{2i}\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\left(\rho_{\lambda}-\bar{\rho}_{\lambda}\right)\right]\left(w\right)\\
= & \frac{1}{2i}\left(\lambda\rho_{\lambda}\left(w\right)-\bar{\lambda}\bar{\rho}_{\lambda}\left(w\right)\right)\\
= & a\tau\left(w\right)+b\sigma\left(w\right)

 Unfortunately, I find the Russian original of Gelfond's article unreadable,
 and Parry's work, stemming from his PhD thesis, is not available online.
 Therefore, it is of some interest to provide a proof suitable for the current
 text.
 A generalization of this proof is used to construct general eigenfunctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest route seems to be direct verification that eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 is correct, as opposed to a derivation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 from first principles.
 This is done below, explicitly showing all steps in laborious detail.
 It's not at all difficult; just a bit hard on the eyes.
 As before, let 
\begin_inset Formula $t\left(x\right)\equiv t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta transform"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 the iterated transformation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(x)$
\end_inset

 be the Heaviside step function as always, and to keep notation breif, let
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\equiv t^{n}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The Gelfond-Parry measure is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(y\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)}{\beta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

where it is more convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{n}\left(y\right)=\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 for the beta-transformation is slightly more convenient to work with than
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 for this particular case.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

and we wish to verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Plugging in directly,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P=\nu\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\nu\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(ax\right)=\Theta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for all constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\le1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 These terms simplify, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 is small or large.
 Explicitly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)=0 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)=1 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

These can be collapsed by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\beta t_{n}=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\beta t_{n}-1=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\left[\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right]+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\beta\nu\left(y\right)-\beta+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)}{\beta^{n}}\\
 & =\beta\nu\left(y\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last sum on the right is just the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion for 1.
 That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t^{n}\left(x\right)-1\right)}{\beta^{n+1}}
\]

\end_inset

This is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 written in a different way (making use of the equivalence 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xform-shift equivalence"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\beta\nu\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

 as claimed.

 It is an analytic equation tying together the entire subshift.
 For each distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, it singles out three completely different bit-sequences out of the subshift,
 and ties them together.
 It is a form of mixing.
 Alternately, a form of interaction: the bit-sequences are not independent
 of one-another; they interact.
 This section attempts to make these notions more precise.

The tying-together of seemingly unrelated sequences seems somehow terribly
 important.
 It is tempting to give this some silly name, such as the

Let's be exceptionally clear about the meaning: equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 defined a map, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 defined a bit-sequence, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

, where equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is the defintion of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 The set of all such bit-sequences defines the shift.
 To emphasize the point, its best to compare side-by-side.
 Copying equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula

1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)\le1

\end_inset

 while
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }x<T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)=T^{n+1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The iterations are running in opposite directions; this is as appropriate,
 since the the transfer operator was a push-forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful here to return to the language of cylinder sets, as opposed
 to point dynamics.
 Recall that the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 was defined as the sigma algebra, the collection of all cylinder sets in
 the product topology of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 A subshift is a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 together with a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set but otherwise
 preserves the subshift: 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

.
 The inverted map 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a pushforward, in that it defines the transfer operator, a linear operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

; explicitly, it is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Insofar as the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 arose in the exploration of the transfer operator, it is not surprising
 that the shift is acting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

backwards

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with point dynamics is that one cannot meaningfully write 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for a real number, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, at least, not without sever contortions that lead back to the Borel algebra.
 Not for lack of trying; the 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_layout Standard
Can the analytic relation be restated in terms of cylinder sets? Yes, and
 it follows in a fairly natural way.
 The first step is to extend 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 to a map 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}:\mathcal{S}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 be the Bernoulli meaure.
 Using the Bernoulli mapping 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,T^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 maps to some cylinder; call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, given some cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

, define
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(A\right)=\mu\left(A\cap\Delta_{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The rotated (pre-)measure is extended likewise: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(A\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(A\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=z/\beta$
\end_inset

 as before, recovering the Parry measure by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

.
 The Parry measure should be invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

, and otherwise yeild eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's check.
 The proof will mirror the one of the previous section.
 Here, it is convenient to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 instead of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 This is primarily a conceptual convenience; the subshift is more easily
 visualized in terms of the mod 1 map.
 Otherwise, the same notation is used, but rescaled, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the cylinder corresponding to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,t^{n}\left(1\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that for every 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and every 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

, one will find that 
\begin_inset Formula $y/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 and, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $y\le\beta-1$
\end_inset

 that also 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(y+1\right)/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 naturally splits into two parts: the cylinder that maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/\beta\right]$
\end_inset

, call it 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and the complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pushfoward action is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\left[\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Two distinct cases emerge.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)<1/\beta$
\end_inset

 then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the second term can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the second line follows from the first by linearity, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

 selected out one of the two branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Meanwhile, when 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)>1/\beta$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cap\Delta_{n}=D$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the first term splits into two: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

while
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\]

\end_inset

Reassembling these pieces and making use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{0}\cap A=A$
\end_inset

 one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\left[\mu\left(A\right)\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)\right]\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)-\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}+\mu\left(A\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)+\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}E\left(\beta;z\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with the constant term as before, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E\left(\beta;z\right) & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

As before, one has for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;1\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\circ t^{-1}=\nu$
\end_inset

 is indeed the measure invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Other eigenvalues can be found for those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The task at hand is then to characterize 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

The function is easily explored numerically.
 It is clearly convergent in the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and has no poles in the disk.
 For almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, there seem to be a countable number of zeros within the disk, accumulating
 uniformly on the boundary as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|\to1$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniformly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be made slightly more precise in the next section, where it is observed
 that, for certain special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 is periodic, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial.
 When it is polynomial, there are a finite number of zeros (obviously; the
 degree of the polynomial), which are distributed approximately uniformly
 near the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|=1$
\end_inset

.
 As the degree of the polynomial increases, so do the number of zeros; but
 they remain distributed approximately evenly.
 In this sense, the limit of infinite degree seems to continue to hold.

 Here of course we are working with a field of characteristic zero (the
 reals), or more properly, the sigma algebra of the Cantor set.
 None-the-less, what sort of inspiration can be taken?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is spurred by the observation that the mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}f=f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is richer than just just a linear operator.
 That is, not only does one have the obvious identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(af+bg\right)=a\mathcal{L}_{T}f+b\mathcal{L}_{T}g$
\end_inset

 for functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f,g$
\end_inset

 and constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

, but one also has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(fg\right)=\mathcal{L}_{T}f\cdot\mathcal{L}_{T}g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(f/g\right)=\mathcal{L}_{T}f\,/\,\mathcal{L}_{T}g$
\end_inset

 so that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is a function field, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 preserves that structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional algebraic identities follow from the sigma algebra of the product
 topology.
 The product topology implies that one can work with function spaces, e.g.
 measures, for which set intersection and set union behave in a field-like
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 belongs to the discrete or continuous spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}e=\lambda e$
\end_inset

, then it also belongs to the spectrum of any iterate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}^{n}e=\lambda^{n}e$
\end_inset

, and so the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}^{n}$
\end_inset

 form a basis for a vector space.
 By linearity, one can arrange for operators of arbitrary spectrum, in that
 one has (at least formally) that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\mathcal{L}_{T}^{n}\right)e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}\lambda^{n}e
\]

\end_inset

for some arbitrary series of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 (presumably convergent, in order to get reasonable results).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Iterated transfer operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand the nature of the steady-state solution (the Frobenius-Perron
 eigenstate), its is worth iterating on the recurrence relation for it,
 by hand, the first few times.
 To do this, it is convenient to write it in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{\Theta\left(y\right)}{\beta}\left[f\left(\alpha\left(y\right)\right)+f\left(\omega\left(y\right)\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(y\right)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y\le\beta/2$
\end_inset

 else zero; this is a step function to denote the vanishing for the operator
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $2y>\beta$
\end_inset

.
 (This differs from the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 as the Heaviside step function in earlier sections; the intent is the same,
 but the goal is to have a briefer notation here.
 Which is which should be clear from context.) The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(y\right)=y/\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\alpha\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 are convenient shorthands for symbolic iteration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Iterating once gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\mathcal{L}^{2}f\right]\left(y\right)= & \frac{\Theta\left(y\right)}{\beta^{2}} & \left[\Theta\left(\alpha\left(y\right)\right)\left[f\left(\alpha^{2}\left(y\right)\right)+f\left(\left(\omega\circ\alpha\right)\left(y\right)\right)\right]+\right.\\
 &  & \left.\Theta\left(\omega\left(y\right)\right)\left[f\left(\left(\alpha\circ\omega\right)\left(y\right)\right)+f\left(\omega^{2}\left(y\right)\right)\right]\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Using a simplified notation 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(y\right)=f\left(\alpha\left(y\right)\right)+f\left(\omega\left(y\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 allows this to be iterated a third time:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\mathcal{L}^{3}f\right]\left(y\right)= & \frac{\Theta\left(y\right)}{\beta^{3}} & \left[\Theta\left(\alpha\left(y\right)\right)\left[\Theta\left(\alpha^{2}\left(y\right)\right)g\left(\alpha^{2}\left(y\right)\right)+\Theta\left(\omega\alpha\left(y\right)\right)g\left(\omega\alpha\left(y\right)\right)\right]+\right.\\
 &  & \left.\Theta\left(\omega\left(y\right)\right)\left[\Theta\left(\alpha\omega\left(y\right)\right)g\left(\alpha\omega\left(y\right)\right)+\Theta\left(\omega^{2}\left(y\right)\right)g\left(\omega^{2}\left(y\right)\right)\right]\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and a fourth time, this time omitting the argument, and the various nesting
 parenthesis.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\mathcal{L}^{4}f\right]\left(y\right)= & \frac{\Theta\left(y\right)}{\beta^{4}} & \left[\Theta\alpha\Theta\alpha^{2}\left[\Theta\alpha^{3}g\alpha^{3}+\Theta\omega\alpha^{2}g\omega\alpha^{2}\right]+\right.\\
 &  & \Theta\alpha\Theta\omega\alpha\left[\Theta\alpha\omega\alpha g\alpha\omega\alpha+\Theta\omega^{2}\alpha g\omega^{2}\alpha\right]\\
 &  & \Theta\omega\Theta\alpha\omega\left[\Theta\alpha^{2}\omega g\alpha^{2}\omega+\Theta\omega\alpha\omega g\omega\alpha\omega\right]\\
 &  & \left.\Theta\omega\Theta\omega^{2}\left[\Theta\alpha\omega^{2}g\alpha\omega^{2}+\Theta\omega^{3}g\omega^{3}\right]\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Notice that the primary structure is given by a product of step functions.
 This is more conveniently visualized as a tree:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any given iteration, the result is the sum of the vertexes at a given
 level, while the product of step functions is the product of the step functions
 in the tree, following the path to each node.
 Because any particular step function might be zero, it effectively acts
 to cut off the tree at that location.
 It is therefore interesting to understand general products of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 functions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{x}\left(y\right)=\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left(y\right)=\gamma_{0}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\left(y\right)=\gamma_{1}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

, so that a general iterated sequence of intermixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

's and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

's can be written uniformly in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Given a sequence of bits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{n}$
\end_inset

 with each 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 being either zero or one, the iterated sequence of functions can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\gamma_{b_{0}}\gamma_{b_{1}}\gamma_{b_{2}}\cdots\gamma_{b_{n}}\right)\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[b_{0}+\frac{b_{1}}{\beta}+\frac{b_{2}}{\beta^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{b_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\right]+\frac{y}{\beta^{n+1}}\label{eq:not de Rham curve}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha^{n}\left(y\right)=\frac{y}{\beta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

while 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega^{2}\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{y}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and, in general, that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega^{n}\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\frac{1}{\beta}+\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}+\cdots\frac{1}{\beta^{n-1}}\right]+\frac{y}{\beta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

Iterated sequences of pairs of functions, of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{b_{0}}\gamma_{b_{1}}\gamma_{b_{2}}\cdots\gamma_{b_{n}}$
\end_inset

 are reminiscent of de Rham curves, which generalize Cesaro curves and the
 Koch snowflake.
 The proper definition of a de Rham curve assumes the sequence is of infinite
 length, and applies a certain continuity condition, and is generally carried
 out on the complex plane, so that a continuous, nowhere-differentiable
 curve results.
 Here, the curve is distinctly not continuous: eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:not de Rham curve"

\end_inset

 is a finite-length form of the shift series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 which can be visualized as the expander function pdr 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
The Tree Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 and value for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, define the tree function as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}\left(\left(b_{k}\right);y\right)=\Theta\left(y\right)\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\Theta\left(\gamma_{b_{0}}\gamma_{b_{1}}\gamma_{b_{2}}\cdots\gamma_{b_{n}}\left(y\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

For any given fixed sequence of bits and value of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, this function is either zero or one.
 One way to understand this function is to ask how it varies for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, but with the bit sequence coming from the Bernoulli shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bernoulli-bits"

\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=b_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This simplifies notation, so that one can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}\left(x;y\right)=T_{\beta}\left(\left(b_{k}\left(x\right)\right);y\right)=\Theta\left(y\right)\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\Theta\left(\gamma_{x;n}\left(y\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{x;n}\left(y\right)=\gamma_{b_{0}}\gamma_{b_{1}}\gamma_{b_{2}}\cdots\gamma_{b_{n}}\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Its clear that the tree function has maximum support when 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

.

 gamma functions.
 Both figures show gamma functions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.6$
\end_inset

; the one on the left shows them for 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0$
\end_inset

, while the one on the right shows them for 
\begin_inset Formula $y=0.7$
\end_inset

.
 Every gamma function is a sequence of plateaus; the zig-zag line is a high-orde
r gamma, essentially showing the limiting case.
 The tree function is unity whenever all of these curves are below 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and is zero when above.
 So, for example, for the left figure, the tree function is unity, for all
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 less than about 0.4952; it drops to zero, then returns to unity above 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.5$
\end_inset

, until about 0.6221, when it briefly plunges and rises again.
 Then, another dip, before finally settling to zero near 0.6541.
 For the right figure, a high-order zig-zag rises above 0.8 somewhere near
 0.4914; then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{x;1}\left(0.7\right)$
\end_inset

 rises above 0.8 and stays there, driving the tree function to zero, rendering
 all other orders irrelevant.

Haar Basis Matrix Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symmetric Haar wavelets are built from the mother wavelet
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{for }0\le x<1/2\\
-1 & \mbox{for }1/2\le x<1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and has individual wavelets given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{nj}\left(x\right)=2^{n/2}h\left(2^{n}x-j\right)\;\mbox{ for }0\le j\le2^{n}-1
\]

\end_inset

The matrix elements of the transfer operator are
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle mi\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|nj\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}h_{mi}\left(x\right)\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}h_{nj}\right]\left(x\right)dx
\]

\end_inset

where the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xfer oper"

\end_inset

.
 Computing these by hand promptly pushes into a big mess.
 One can obtain explicit expressions, just that they are tedious to obtain.
 Some preliminary observations include that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle mi\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|nj\right\rangle =0\;\mbox{ if }\beta\le i/2^{m-1}
\]

\end_inset

because the transfer operator vanishes above 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 In the same vein, matrix elements vanish unless 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]\cap\left[\frac{\beta j}{2^{n}},\frac{\beta\left(j+1\right)}{2^{n}}\right]\ne\emptyset
\]

\end_inset

or if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]\cap\left[\beta\left(\frac{j}{2^{n}}-\frac{1}{2}\right),\beta\left(\frac{j+1}{2^{n}}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\ne\emptyset
\]

\end_inset

In all other cases, the Haar wavelets completely fail to overlap, and thus
 the matrix elements are zero.
 In addition, only three pairs of wavelets overlap in a non-zero fashion.
 That is, for a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$
\end_inset

 and

 are the values for which
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\beta j}{2^{n}}\in\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]\;\mbox{ or }\;\frac{\beta\left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)}{2^{n}}\in\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]\;\mbox{ or }\;\frac{\beta\left(j+1\right)}{2^{n}}\in\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and likewise for three more.
 The observation is that the integral vanishes unless the first wavelet
 intersects an edge transition of the second wavelet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary failure of this basis is that there is no obvious way to diagonalize
 the transfer operator in this basis.
 There is no obvious way of solving it, of finding it's eigenfunctions and
 eigenvalues, other than by brute-force numerical attack.

Consider the two iterators 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}\left(y\right)=\min\left(\frac{\beta}{2},\beta y\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}\left(y\right)=\max\left(0,\beta y-\frac{\beta}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Individually, they are the two arms of the beta shift.
 Here, they have been separated from each other, so that the full domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le y\le1$

 is allowed.
 Exploring all possible inter-iterations for these gives the Julia set for
 the transfer operator: it indicates where a point 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 There are several related ways to visualize this.
 One way is to fix

\begin_layout Section
Hessenberg basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a set of Haar-like wavelets in which the transfer operator is of
 the form of a Hessenberg operator - that is, the operator becomes almost
 upper-diagonal, with only one diagonal, just below the main diagonal, that
 is non-zero.
 Explicitly, the transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\right]_{ij}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\right]_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j+1$
\end_inset

.
 A matrix having this form is called a Hessenberg matrix; such matrices
 have various interesting properties; among others, they generalize the
 Jacobi matrix.
 This chapter explicitly constructs an infinite-dimensional Hessenberg matrix,
 which may now be called a Hessenberg operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hessenberg operators occur naturally in spectral measure theory; some of
 this will be reviewed in several later chapters.
 To get a flavor for what is to come: Given a Hessenberg operator, one may
 construct a system of orthogonal polynomials that provide a basis for square-in
tegrable holomorphic functions on some domain of the complex plane.
 Such a space is called a Bergman space; in this sense it generalizes the
 Jacobi operator for real Borel measures.
 This basis of polynomials in turn allows the Hessenberg operator to be
 explicitly seen as a shift operator on that domain, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[Hf\right]\left(z\right)=zf\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 the Hessenberg operator and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 a holomorphic function (specifically a Bergman function) on the Bergman
 domain.
 But all of this is for later chapters; its mentioned here only to whet
 the appetite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TODO: More motivation is needed for this line of reasoning.
 After all, we have an explicit solution for the eigenfunctions, it is given
 in expression

\end_inset

.
 So, why bother writing the transfer operator as a Hessenberg operator?
 What does this teach us?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hessenberg wavelet basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 can be fairly easily brought into Hessenberg matrix form.
 A sequence of of orthonormal functions is constructed in this section;
 when used as a basis, the transfer operator becomes almost upper-diagonal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick to the construction is to define wavelets such that the transfer
 operator applied each wavelet causes the end-points of the wavelet to exactly
 line up with the end- or mid-points of previous wavelets, thus avoiding
 the nasty interval-overlap algebra required with the Haar basis.
 This is accomplished by carefully picking the midpoint of the next wavelet
 in the sequence to be located exactly at the discontinuity of the transfer
 operator applied to the previous wavelet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction proceeds as follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{0}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta/2}} & \mbox{for }0\le x\le\beta/2\\
0 & \mbox{for }\beta/2<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Consider 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal L}_{\beta}\psi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 It is the sum of two parts: two step-functions; one which is constant for
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\le\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and another that is constant for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\le\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Solving explicitly for the location of the step, it is 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\beta\left(\beta-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

.
 For convenience, define 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=\beta\left(\beta-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 These will anchor a series of midpoints, beginning with 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{-1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Using the midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}$
\end_inset

, construct the wavelet
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{1}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{m_{1}}\sqrt{\frac{m_{1}\left(m_{0}-m_{1}\right)}{m_{0}}} & \mbox{for }0\le x\le m_{1}\\
\frac{-1}{m_{0}-m_{1}}\sqrt{\frac{m_{1}\left(m_{0}-m_{1}\right)}{m_{0}}} & \mbox{for }m_{1}<x\le m_{0}\\
0 & \mbox{for }m_{0}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Note that this is normalized to unit length: 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\left|\psi_{1}\left(x\right)\right|^{2}dx=1$
\end_inset

 and that it is explicitly orthogonal to the first: 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\psi_{1}\left(x\right)\psi_{0}\left(x\right)dx=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal L}_{\beta}\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 As always, it is the sum of two parts.
 The midpoint of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 is at 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=\beta\left(\beta-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 and this mid-point is mapped to one of two different places.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}<1/2$
\end_inset

 then it is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}=\beta m_{1}$
\end_inset

 else it maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}=\beta\left(m_{1}-1/2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}<1/2$
\end_inset

, define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{2}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{for }0\le x\le m_{1}\\
\frac{1}{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)\left(m_{0}-m_{2}\right)}{m_{0}-m_{1}}} & \mbox{for }m_{1}\le x\le m_{2}\\
\frac{-1}{\left(m_{0}-m_{2}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)\left(m_{0}-m_{2}\right)}{m_{0}-m_{1}}} & \mbox{for }m_{2}<x\le m_{0}\\
0 & \mbox{for }m_{0}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

else define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{2}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{m_{2}}\sqrt{\frac{m_{2}\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}{m_{1}}} & \mbox{for }0\le x\le m_{2}\\
\frac{-1}{\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{m_{2}\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}{m_{1}}} & \mbox{for }m_{2}\le x\le m_{1}\\
0 & \mbox{for }m_{1}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Because each end of the interval on which 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero lies entirely within one of the constant arms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

, one has, by construction, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\psi_{2}\left(x\right)\psi_{1}\left(x\right)dx=0$
\end_inset

 (and, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\psi_{2}\left(x\right)\psi_{0}\left(x\right)dx=0$
\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the basis can be constructed iteratively, based on these examples.
 The midpoints are given by iterating 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}=T_{\beta}\left(m_{p-1}\right)=T_{\beta}^{p}\left(m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

'th iterate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{l}$
\end_inset

 be largest midpoint smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $l<p$
\end_inset

); let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{u}$
\end_inset

 be the smallest midpoint larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $l<p$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{-1}=0$
\end_inset

 initiate the sequence by providing the smallest-possible 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

midpoint
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

 already provides the largest possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{p}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{for }0\le x\le m_{l}\\
\frac{C_{p}}{\left(m_{p}-m_{l}\right)} & \mbox{for }m_{l}\le x\le m_{p}\\
\frac{-C_{p}}{\left(m_{u}-m_{p}\right)} & \mbox{for }m_{p}<x\le m_{u}\\
0 & \mbox{for }m_{u}<x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:Hess-Haar-basis-fn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By construction, this has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\psi_{p+1}\left(x\right)\psi_{n}\left(x\right)dx=0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $n<p+1$
\end_inset

.
 The normalization constant is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{p}=\sqrt{\frac{\left(m_{p}-m_{l}\right)\left(m_{u}-m_{p}\right)}{m_{u}-m_{l}}}
\]

\end_inset

which is determined by requiring that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\left|\psi_{p}\left(x\right)\right|^{2}dx=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matrix Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above-defined basis provides the Hessenberg representation for the transfer
 operator.
 Defining
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle n\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{1}\psi_{n}\left(x\right)\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\psi_{m}\right]\left(x\right)dx\label{eq:hessen-matrix-elts}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

this has the expected Hessenberg form, in that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle n\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle =0\quad\mbox{ for }n>m+1
\]

\end_inset

This is just one diagonal short of being actually solvable.

 Are they complete? Obviously the

 Which is which depends on how the point

 These values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 They are dense in the interval

 Thus, most

\end_inset

\[
\delta\left(y-x\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\psi_{n}\left(y\right)\psi_{n}\left(x\right)

as a resolution of the identity?

\begin_layout Standard
The question of completeness dogs some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 assumptions one wants to make.
 For example, if the set of states is complete, and the resolution of the
 identity holds, then one expects that the transfer operator resolves to
 the iterated function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta\left(y-\left(\beta x\,\mod1\right)\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\psi_{n}\left(y\right)\left\langle n\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle \psi_{m}\left(x\right)

 It is not all that much.
 Numerical exploration suggests that the spectrum is on or near a circle
 lying in the complex plane

 Both systems agree to at least six decimal places, if not more.
 Both show sporadic eigenvalues off the circle, but these are not numerically
 stable; ergo, the only valid eigenvalues are those on the circle.
 The matrix entries were constructed using the midpoint algorithm, described
 in the last section.
 To verify that they are accurate, several techniques were used: numerical
 integration to confirm orthogonality, and the use of the GnuMP multi-precision

 That is, for each finite

 In the limit, there may be accumulation points: points where the eigenvalues
 accumulate to a limit point, in a standard topological sense.
 What should that that topological space be? For finite

\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|-1/\beta\sim\mathcal{O}\left(1/N\right)$

 As to uniformity, it seems that the spacing between nearest neighbors is

Thus, the minimal closure, the minimal extrapolation to limit points strongly
 suggests that the limit points really do lie, uniformly distributed, on

 Then, writing a given accumulation point as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\beta^{-1}\exp2\pi i\phi$
\end_inset

, what the numerics do not reveal, or, at least, do not easily reveal, is
 whether the allowed values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 are always rational, irrational or might have some other regular structure.
 The numerical exploration does suggest that the eigenvalues are dense on
 the circle.
 Certainly it is the case Hessenberg basis is countable, an so one would
 expect the eigenvalue spectrum obtained in this way to be at least countable,
 as well.
 Whether it is also uncountable seems unknowable in this naive sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This question is interesting because if only rational 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 are allowed, then the decaying eigenfunctions belong to a cyclic group,
 and exhibit an exact form of PoincarÃ© recurrence as they decay.
 If irrational 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

For 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$

 the spectrum is exactly known.
 This has been explored by various authors

.
 To recap, it takes several forms, depending on the function space that
 one chooses to work in.
 If one restricts oneself to polynomial eigenfunctions, then the spectrum
 is real, non-negative (it has an extensive kernel) and has eigenvalues
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenfunctions are the Bernoulli polynomials.
 Restricting to square-integrable eigenfunctions, the spectrum continuous,
 having eigenvalues on the unit disk in the complex plane.
 The continuous-spectrum eigenfunctions (for eigenvalues other than 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

) can be understood in several ways: if forced to be differentiable, then
 they are not bounded (they diverge) at the endpoints of the interval.
 If forced to be bounded, then they are fractal (non-smooth) over the entire
 interval.
 The unitary spectrum corresponds to differentiable-nowhere eigenfunctions
 (wait, or continuous-nowhere? I forget.)

This shows a numerically-computed decaying eigenfunction of period two,
 for

 It is period two, in that it corresponds to an eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=-1/\beta=-0.625$

, so that after one iteration of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 This can be confirmed, numerically: after one iteration, the sign really
 does flip, to within numerical errors.
 This was computed by numerically diagonalizing the

 For any period-two eigenfunction, the real and imaginary parts would have
 no coupling, and would be independent of each other; either one could be
 set to zero and one would still have a valid eigenfunction.
 This differs from the case of period-three and higher, where the real and
 imaginary parts are expected to mix.
 (Nor are the two components orthogonal, as one might expect.) The eigenfunction
 is also fantastic in that only slightly different numerics result in a
 completely different eigenfunction being computed.
 Even the functions resulting from diagonalizing the

(Non-)Unitarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numerical results suggest a hypothesis that perhaps some fragment of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is unitary, as it is ordinarily the case that when eigenvalues appear on
 the unit circle, it is because an operator is unitary.
 That does not seem to be the case here.
 Specifically, define the Frobenius-Perron eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as the one satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho=\rho$
\end_inset

 and normalizing it to unit length, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \rho\right\Vert =1$
\end_inset

 in the Hilbert (mean-square) norm.
 Define the reduced operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 in terms of the matrix elements
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\beta}\left\langle n\left|{\cal R}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle =\left\langle n\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle -\left\langle \rho\vert n\right\rangle \left\langle \rho\vert m\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

That is, it is just the beta shift operator, with the Frobenius-Perron eigenvect
or removed, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}\rho=0$
\end_inset

 .
 Its rescaled, so that the remaining eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 lie on the unit circle.
 Is this operator unitary in any way? That is, might either 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}\mathcal{R}_{\beta}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}^{\dagger}\mathcal{R}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 be the identity? Here, the dagger 
\begin_inset Formula $\dagger$
\end_inset

 is just the transpose, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is purely real.
 Numerical exploration clearly shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is neither unitary on the left nor on the right.
 Not a surprise, but does leave the understanding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 in a curious situation.

 There seems to be a cutable number of these; the subtraction won't be straight-

Invariant Measure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 be the vector that solves
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\left\langle n\left|{\cal L}_{\beta}\right|m\right\rangle v_{m}=v_{n}\label{eq:fp coefficients}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is readily computed numerically, and it is straightforward to verify
 the numerics by confirming that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho\left(x\right)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}v_{m}\psi_{m}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

is the invariant measure of equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 being the wavelets of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Hess-Haar-basis-fn"

\end_inset

.
 This expansion seems to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

make sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as the discontinuities seen in the graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

\end_inset

 occur at exactly the midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

 and the size of each discontinuity appears to get smaller as 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 gets larger.
 Given that the wavelet 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{p}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 has its central discontinuity at 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

 and is bounded on left and right by midpoints of lower order, this expansion
 seems to be very natural.
 This is supported by the diagram 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for selected values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 These values of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{n}$
\end_inset

 are real, positive, and quickly get small; there are no difficulties or
 issues of convergence.

\begin_layout Standard
The truncated ordinary generating function associated with the eigenvector

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

with the ordinary generating function being the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$

 A numerical study of this function indicates that most of the

\end_inset

 zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{N}$
\end_inset

 are arranged approximately on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The arrangement appear to be quite uniform, with more-or-less equi-distant
 spacing of the zeros.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 increases, it seems that more of the zeros get closer to the circle, although
 the numerical instabilities associated with double-precision math make
 this difficult to control; an arbitrary-precision eigenvalue solver would
 be needed to confirm this behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this behavior persists, and it seems that it will, then the limit

 Thus, the zeros already found by means of eqn

 these are masquerading as

as both sides have zeros arranged in circles of unit radius.
 The right hand side is defined and explored in detail in the next chapter.
 Superficially, this hypothesis is clearly false: coefficients on the left
 are all real and positive; coefficients on the right - the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$

, are bits, either zero or one.
 Yet both exhibit a circle of zeros.

\begin_layout Standard
The iteration of the midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

, that is, the iterated series 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{n}=T_{\beta}^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 is ergodic in the unit interval, for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 However, for certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the midpoint iterates will hit the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift map has a discontinuity.
 Here, iteration stops: at the next step, this point is defined to iterate
 to zero, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

.
 Zero is a fixed point, and so there is nowhere further to go.
 This section explores these special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the definition in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

, one can consider the modified map, where the less-than sign has been altered
 to a less-than-or-equals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{\le}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this map, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 iterates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

, which is just the initial midpoint itself.
 In this case, the halted orbits become periodic orbits.
 There is a third possibility, to simply remove the points 0, 1 and 1/2
 from the domain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{<}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0<x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x<1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this case, if the midpoint iterates to 1/2, it can be taken to simply
 have wandered out of the domain of validity.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wander
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used here in the technical sense: The map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is dissipative in two different senses: first, in the obvious sense, the
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<x$
\end_inset

 wander away after exactly one iteration; secondly, the mid-point iterates
 wander down to zero, never to return, unless they are made explicitly periodic
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{\le}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 They can be imagined to be prototypes of a bifurcation point,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 of the three variants, in the strict topological sense of a quotient space.
 Thus, interestingly, for the beta shift, the periodic orbits and the fixed
 point both belong to the same equivalence class.
 This has some interesting implications when one compares the beta shift
 to other iterated maps, such as the logistic map, which have non-trivial
 stable regions.
 Topologically, it would seem that one can perform a kind of surgery, attaching
 stable regions exactly into those spots where, in the beta shift, one has
 an equivalence class.
 This solves (at least for me) the long-standing problem of exactly how
 to properly describe the topological conjugacy between different kinds
 of iterated maps.

 When

 These are the

 The first trouble spot is visible for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}=1/2$

\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi$
\end_inset

 and a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$

 The midpoint

 crosses 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$

\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.465\cdots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.839\cdots$

\begin_inset Formula $p=3$
\end_inset

 It also crosses discontinuously downwards at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi$
\end_inset

 This crossing point has already been assigned to a shorter orbit.
 The midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{3}$
\end_inset

 has three new crossings.
 It also rises to touch 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi$
\end_inset

; but this has already been assigned to shorter periods.
 The midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{4}$
\end_inset

 has six new crossings.
 Crossings will generally fall to the left and right of earlier crossings,
 and so are related in a bracketing relationship.
 The bracketing is not the full binary tree; it is pruned, as shorter period
 assignments can knock out longer one.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{4}$
\end_inset

 falls back down at the 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}$
\end_inset

 crossing at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.465\cdots$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m_{4}$
\end_inset

 never even gets close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

; it won't bracket until later.

This appears to be Sloane's OEIS A001037 which has a number of known relationshi
ps to roots of unity, Lyndon words, and the number of orbits in the tent
 map.
 The trouble spots are the positive real roots of polynomials of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\left\{ b_{k}\right\} }\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{n}-\beta^{n-1}-b_{1}\beta^{n-2}-b_{2}\beta^{n-3}-\cdots-1=0
\]

\end_inset

with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 being certain binary bit sequences.
 There is just one such (positive, real) root for each such polynomial.
 These polynomials are relatively prime, in the sense that a bit-sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is disallowed if it has the same root as some lower-order polynomial.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is disallowed; it has the same root as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

.
 Equivalently, the quadratic is a factor of the quartic; the quartic is
 not relatively prime with respect to the quadratic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for the appearence of the necklace-counting function is straight-forw
ard: it is counting the number of distinct orbits of a given length.
 An orbit of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is, by defintion, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x=T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Such an orbit generates a binary string, of length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 corresponding to whether 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{j}\left(x\right)<1/2$
\end_inset

 is true or not.
 A cyclic permutation of such a string still corresponds to the same orbit;
 a reversed permutation does not: thus, it is a necklace without reversal.
 The necklace-counting function gives the number of distinct, unique orbits
 of a given length that cannot be factored into shorter orbits.
 The beta transformation has the property that every possible orbit does
 occur; none are prohibited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A recurring point of confusion is that the bit-string defining the polynomial
 is not a necklace; it cannot be rotated.
 Each bit-string corresponds to a unique polynomial, having roots that differ
 from those of other polynomials.
 The polynomials also have a canonical order, fixed as the integer that
 corresponds to the bit-string; they cannot be re-ordered.
 Ideas such as Lyndon words apply to the orbits, but not to the defining
 polynomials.
 The ordering of the polynomials is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the lexicographic ordering of the Lyndon words, and cannot be brought into
 this order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{n}$
\end_inset

 are given explicitly by Moreau's necklace-counting function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{d|n}2^{d}\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the sum runs over all integers 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 that divide 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the MÃ¶bius function.
 The generating function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{t}{\frac{1}{2}-t}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}nM_{n}\frac{t^{n}}{1-t^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

which has a radius of convergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|t\right|<1/2$
\end_inset

.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the asymptotic behavior can be trivially deduced from the defining sum:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}=\frac{2^{n}}{n}-\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{2^{n/2}}{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above counting function is for necklaces with only two colors.
 In general, one can have necklaces with 3 or more colors; can that happen
 here? Yes, of course: if one considers the general 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform for 
\begin_inset Formula $2<\beta$
\end_inset

, then, in general, it can be taken as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

kneading transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \beta\right\rceil $
\end_inset

 branches or folds in it.
 The analogous trouble-spots again appear, and they can appear after an
 arbitrary finite-length orbit.
 Insofar as they correspond to periodic orbits, they are necessarily counted
 by the necklace-counting function.
 That is, one must consider all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \beta\right\rceil $
\end_inset

 letters, modulo a cyclic permutation: this is the very definition of a
 necklace (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

circular word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The number of such necklaces is given by the necklace-counting function.
 Each such orbit is necessarily represented by a Lyndon word, which is a
 representative of the conjugacy class of the orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The isomorphism of different systems described by necklace polynomials is

The

trouble spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 occur whenever the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}=T_{\beta}^{k}\left(m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 lands on the starting midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}=m_{0}$
\end_inset

; alternately, when 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k-1}=1/2$
\end_inset

.
 Because of the piece-wise linear form of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th iterate will be a piece-wise collection of polynomials, each of order
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, each of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\left\{ b_{k}\right\} }\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These must be arranged such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\left\{ b_{k}\right\} }\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

 at each discontinuity, as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Location-of-Midpoints"

\end_inset

.
 This constrains the polynomials that can appear; it constrains the possible
 coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

; not all bit-sequences appear.
 The sequences that do appear encode the orbit of the mid-point; see below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table below explicitly shows the polynomials for the first few orders.
 A polynomial is included in the table if it is an iterate of a previous
 polynomial, and if it's real root is bracketed by the roots of the earlier
 iterates.
 Adopting an ordinal numbering, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ensuremath{p_{n}\left(\beta\right)}$
\end_inset

 must have the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\begin{cases}
\beta\left(p_{n/2}\left(\beta\right)+1\right)-1 & \mbox{ for \ensuremath{n} even }\\
\beta p_{\left(n-1\right)/2}\left(\beta\right)-1 & \mbox{ for \ensuremath{n} odd }
\end{cases}\label{eq:polynomial recursion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This recursion terminates at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(\beta\right)=\beta-1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The positive real root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 is unique; the other 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 roots are complex; they are arranged in a roughly evenly-spaced ring on
 the complex plane, not far from the unit circle, reminiscent of roots of
 unity.
 There is always a postive real root, which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le r_{n}<2$
\end_inset

; the real roots and the polynomials are in one-to-one correspondence.
 The roots must be bracketed (to the left and right) by the roots of polynomials
 occurring earlier in the sequence; if the root is not bracketed, then the
 corresponding polynomial does not appear in the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bracketing constraint can be represented by a recursive function 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}\left(\rho\right)$
\end_inset

 returning a boolean true/false value, as to whether a given polynomial
 is acceptable.
 It is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta_{n}\left(\rho\right)=\begin{cases}
\Theta\left(r_{n/2}-\rho\right)\cdot\theta_{n/2}\left(\rho\right) & \mbox{ for \ensuremath{n} even }\\
\theta_{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor }\left(\rho\right) & \mbox{ for \ensuremath{n} odd }
\end{cases}\label{eq:theta mask}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This uses a definition for the Heaviside 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 that is one only for strictly positive 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

, and is zero otherwise.
 In numerical work, the test should be bounded away from zero.
 The recursion compares the candidate 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to some root at each lower order.
 The recursion terminates at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}\left(\rho\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a valid polynomial, and thus a valid root, if and only if
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Effectvely, this states that roots of higher-order polynomials must be
 less than a certain sequence of lower-order roots.
 This is visible in the location of the discontinuities in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Location-of-Midpoints"

\end_inset

: new discontinuities at higher orders must occur to the left of earlier
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded from the list simply because it is not an iterate of an earlier
 polynomial, even though it has the interesting real root 
\begin_inset Formula $1.324717957244746\cdots$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

silver constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The numbering scheme does not even have a way of numbering this particular
 polynomial.
 Despite this, the silver constant does appear, but a bit later, as the
 root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{8}=\beta^{5}-\beta^{4}-1$
\end_inset

, which is an allowed polynomial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}=\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded because it has 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

 as a root, which was previously observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}=\beta^{5}-\beta^{4}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded because it's root, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{9}=1.497094048762796\cdots$
\end_inset

 is greater than its predecessor 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

; the recursive algorithm does not compare it to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}$
\end_inset

 is relatively prime to the earlier polynomials, so irreducibility is not
 a sufficient criterion; the root must also be less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The indexing has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

, taken as binary, encodes both the coefficients of the polynomial, and
 also the orbit of the midpoint.
 The degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 of the polynomial is identical to the period 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 of the orbit; it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=\left\lceil \log_{2}\left(2n+1\right)\right\rceil $
\end_inset

.
 The bits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the bitstring 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{\pi}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the orbit as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{i}=\Theta\left(T_{\beta}^{i}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\right)=d_{i}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=k_{i}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 are as given before, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:rescaled-bitseq"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 as in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:down-bits"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<\beta/2$
\end_inset

, always.
 By convention, the last digit is always 1, also.

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}$

 was the acceptance function from eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 By abuse of notation, write 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}=\mathds{1}_{\mathcal{B}}\left(n\right)=\theta\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

 for the membership indicator function for this set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 as the pullback of the summatory function for this mask.
 That is, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 be the smallest integer for which the following holds:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=\sum_{n=1}^{\psi_{m}}\theta_{n}
\]

\end_inset

Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 encodes the locations of one-bits in the bitmask 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(\psi_{m}\right)=1$
\end_inset

 by definition.
 Equivalently, it counts the total number of one-bits below that location.
 It is convenient to start the sequence at 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(n\right)=\psi_{n}$
\end_inset

 as equivalent notation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several properties are apparent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{m}\right)=\theta\left(2^{m}-1\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(m\right)=1$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2m\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 By recursion, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{n}m\right)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is odd, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(m\right)=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(\left(m-1\right)/2\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is reminiscent of the Collatz conjecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(m\right)=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{n}\left(2m+1\right)\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted earlier, the number of valid polynomials of each order are given
 by the necklace counting function 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, one has, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{2^{m}-1}\theta\left(n\right)=\sum_{k=2}^{m+1}M_{k}\equiv S_{m}
\]

\end_inset

Using the 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{m}$
\end_inset

 defined immediately above, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(S_{m}\right)=2^{m}-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\left(S_{m}+1\right)=2^{m}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 as a real number is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\theta_{n}2^{-n}=0.93258880035365\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 At this time, this does not appear in OEIS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Leaders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important subsequence consists of the leaders of the doubling sequences.
 These can be defined in several equivalent ways.
 One property of the bitmask is that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(m\right)=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{n}m\right)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 A leader 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the smallest such 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 at the front of such a doubling sequence: it is either an odd number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\left(2k+1\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(\lambda\right)=1$
\end_inset

 or it is an even number of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=2^{h}\left(2k+1\right),h>0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{h}\left(2k+1\right)\right)=1$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{h-1}\left(2k+1\right)\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The minimal power 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 defining the leader will be called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

height of the leader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equivalently, the leaders can be defined as a subsequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 By definition, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(\psi_{m}\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 is odd, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 is a leader.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

 is even, then it is a leader if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(\psi_{m}/2\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a valid index 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{m}$
\end_inset

, it is useful to define a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 that provides the map 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda\left(\psi_{m}\right)=2^{h}\left(2\psi_{m}+1\right)\label{eq:Leadership function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This map is not monotonic: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\left(1\right)=3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\left(2\right)=10$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\left(3\right)=7$
\end_inset

.
 It is, however, one-to-one, as leaders are always a product of an odd number
 times some power of two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sorting the leaders into ascending order, the start of the sequence is 1,3,7,10,
13,15,25,29,31,...
 This sequence is not currently known to OEIS.
 It is handy to count from one, and to assign 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=3$
\end_inset

 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Location of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Golden Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The location of the roots can be visualized by using the normalization of
 the Parry-Gelfond measure.
 The function in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 or more generally 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:generalized-eigenfunction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be integrated in a straight-forward manner.
 One has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I\left(\beta;z\right)=\int_{0}^{1}\nu_{\beta;z}\left(x\right)dx=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{\beta^{n}}\int_{0}^{1}d_{n}\left(x\right)dx=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{\beta^{n}}T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The result is a sawtooth, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Normalization-Integral"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Each discontinuity corresponds to the real root of one of the polynomials.
 The first few are labelled by the integer labels from the previous table.
 The doubling sequences and their leaders are easy to identify.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bracketing intervals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That this figure is a self-similar fractal is presumably self-evident.
 Thus, for example, the graph to to right of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=\varphi=1.618...$
\end_inset

 repeats again between 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 and again between 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Each such bracketed interval contains a unique largest discontinuity; it
 can be seen as being at the front of a doubling sequence.
 Each discontinuity is in one-to-one correspondence with a bracketing interval;
 the bracketing intervals are all self-similar to one-another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notation for bracketed intervals will be needed later, and can be introduced
 now.
 Write 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 for the discontinuity 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 bracketed on the left and right by 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is literally meant that the three roots are in order, with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\ell}<r_{f}<r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 with the inequalities being strict.
 Not all ascending sequences of three roots form a valid bracket; valid
 brackets will be defined shortly.
 But first, some examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the liberty to write 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}=2$
\end_inset

, the interval to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $1\Mapsto3\Mapsfrom0$
\end_inset

.
 The most prominent self-similar intervals are then 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Mapsto10\Mapsfrom1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4\Mapsto36\Mapsfrom2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $8\Mapsto136\Mapsfrom4$
\end_inset

.
 In each of these examples, the front was also a leader, with leadership
 as defined in the previous section.
 This is not always the case: the brackets 
\begin_inset Formula $1\Mapsto6\Mapsfrom3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\Mapsto12\Mapsfrom6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\Mapsto24\Mapsfrom12$
\end_inset

 are clearly visible; they are a part of an index-doubling sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extreme left side can be assigned the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\infty}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the entire interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the bracket 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty\Mapsto1\Mapsfrom0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bracket tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The brackets can be arranged into a binary tree, recursively defined.
 Any valid interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 can be split into two: the left side and the right side.
 These two pieces are 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto2f\Mapsfrom f$
\end_inset

 on the left, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\Mapsto\Lambda\left(f\right)\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 on the right, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is the leader function given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Leadership function"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in the previous section.
 Recursion starts with 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty\Mapsto1\Mapsfrom0$
\end_inset

.
 A bracketing relationship is valid if and only if it appears in this recursive
 binary tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The left and right moves 
\begin_inset Formula $L,R$
\end_inset

 on the binary tree can then be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $L:\left(\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho\right)\mapsto\left(\ell\Mapsto2f\Mapsfrom f\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R:\left(\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho\right)\mapsto\left(f\Mapsto\Lambda\left(f\right)\Mapsfrom\rho\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These correspond to a splitting of the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\ell}<r_{f}<r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 likewise.
 The inequalities are strict, and the figure indicates tht the roots are
 dense in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\beta\le2$
\end_inset

, thus, interval subdivision always converges to a point.
 A finite string of 
\begin_inset Formula $L,R$
\end_inset

 moves picks out a unique interval 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\ell}<r_{f}<r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

.
 An infinite string of 
\begin_inset Formula $L,R$
\end_inset

 moves corresponds to a point in the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, and so it appears that the bracket tree provides a surjection onto the
 reals.
 It is a surjection, as both strings 
\begin_inset Formula $LRRR\cdots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RLLL\cdots$
\end_inset

 appear to converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=\varphi$
\end_inset

; the first from the left, the second from the right.
 This resembles the behavior of the dyadic tree.

This figure shows the mapping from the dyadic rationals, interpreted as
 strings of left-right moves, and the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=r_{f}$
\end_inset

 root for the front (center) of the resulting bracket.
 Thus, 1/2 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=\varphi=1.61803...$
\end_inset

 and 1/4 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}=1.46557...$
\end_inset

 while 3/4 maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}=1.83929...$
\end_inset

 The curve is continuous, as the brackets provide a filter that converges
 to a point.
 The brackets are in one-to-one correpondence with dyadic intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $m/2^{n}<\left(2m+1\right)/2^{n+1}<\left(m+1\right)/2^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The extremely sharp drop to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

 on the left side of the chart is due to the brackets 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 being quite wide, as they approach

 Expressed as a set, these are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{B}\left(a,b\right)=\left\{ n\in\mathbb{N}:r_{n}\in\left(a,b\right)\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

The indicator function is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathds{1}_{\mathcal{B}\left(a,b\right)}\left(n\right)=\theta\left(a,b;n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This generalizes the earlier definition of eqn

 to arbitrary subintervals.
 It can be deduced by writing the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 as a countable union of brackets 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

, taking care to select brackets that are disjoint, and then enumerating
 the roots inside each bracket.

Distribution of

-Golden indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems natural to ask how the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are distributed with respect to the real roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It appears that there is no such distribution, or rather, that it accumulates
 entirely at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Distribution-of-Golden"

\end_inset

 shows the numerically computed (bin-counted) distribution of the zeros
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for three different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

, almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 have roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 that approach 2.

The bin-counted distribution of roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for three different cutoffs, and the corresponding eyeballed fit.
 Bin-counting proceeds by dividing the range 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

 into 1303 equalâ€“width bins.
 Proceeding methodically to find roots for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, each root is assigned to a bin.
 At the end of the counting process, the bin-counts are normalized by the
 width of the bin, and the total number of roots observed (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 by the Moreau counting function).
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the distribution appears to be approximately exponential (but not quite
 - there is a deviation from linearity in the graph above, just barely discernab
le by naked eye).
 Three different 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

's are shown, and three eyeballed fits.
 The general trend appears to be that, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, the distribution is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\simeq k+3-\log_{2}k\simeq\log_{2}M_{k+3}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

 limit accumulates all the measure at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a relative statement, as it is comparing an implicit measure on
 the integers to the distribution of the roots.
 Thus, there are several (ambiguous) ways to phrase the result.
 One is to say that small integers (those 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

) describe roots that accumulate at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

.
 The converse description is to say that for any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<2$
\end_inset

, the values of the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 needed to label the roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 become unboundedly large.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $1/1375\left(r_{n+1}-r_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Increasing the number of roots essentially just rescales this graph, making
 it progressively more vertical.
 In essence, almost all of the roots accumulate near 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

; roots become increasingly rare the smaller the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 In the limit, one might say that essentially all roots are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

: although the roots are dense in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

, the counting measure indicates that they are accumulating at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 only.

\begin_layout Subsection
Complex Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the complex roots? Numerical work clearly indicates that they seem
 to be approximately cyclotomic in some sense or another.
 They seem to be more-or-less uniformly distributed in an approximate circle,
 always.
 The modulus of most of the complex roots appear to be less than one.
 This is violated for the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+2}-\beta^{k+1}-1$
\end_inset

, where some of the roots in the right-hand quadrant have a modulus larger
 than one.
 By contrast, the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}\beta^{j}$
\end_inset

 seem to always have a modulus less than one.
 These two seem to be the extreme cases: in general, the polynomials appear
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approximately cyclotomic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Its not clear how to make this statement more precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These numerical results can be argued heuristically: just divide the polynomial
 by it's leading order.
 That is, a general polynomial of this form is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}b_{j}z^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

with the convention that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, and the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{p}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a terminating orbit.
 Dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k+1}$
\end_inset

gives a series 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\frac{1}{z}-\frac{b_{1}}{z^{2}}-\frac{b_{2}}{z^{3}}-\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Clearly, this can have a zero only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<2$
\end_inset

 as otherwise, the terms get too small too quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Golden 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci Sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that the golden ratio occurs as limit of the ratio of adjacent
 Fibonacci numbers:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}}{F_{m-1}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}=F_{m-1}+F_{m-2}$
\end_inset

.
 There is a generalization of this, which also has received attention: the
 tribonacci, quadronacci, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 sequences, whose limits are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{n}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{(n)}}{F_{m-1}^{(n)}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{(n)}=F_{m-1}^{(n)}+F_{m-2}^{(n)}+\cdots+F_{m-n}^{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible that the real roots of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 are also the roots of such sequences? But of course they are! Given a finite
 string of binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

, write the beta-Fibonacci sequence as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=b_{0}F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}+b_{1}F_{m-2}^{\{b\}}+\cdots b_{k}F_{m-k}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta-Fibonacci
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is needed because the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized Fibonacci sequence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is already in wide circulation for the special case of all bits being one.
 The ratio of successive terms is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha^{\{b\}}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

and is given as the (positive) real root of the polynomial
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-b_{0}\beta^{k}-b_{1}\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k}=0
\]

\end_inset

These polynomials and their roots were already enumerated and tabulated
 in the previous section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci sequences do not appear by accident: these sequences
 have an ordinary generating function (OGF) given by the polynomial! That
 is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}z^{m}F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\frac{z^{k}}{1-b_{0}z-b_{1}z^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{k+1}}=\frac{1}{zp_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k}$
\end_inset

 in the numerator serves only to initiate the sequence so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\{b\}}=\cdots=F_{k-1}^{\{b\}}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{k}^{\{b\}}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These sequences are generic: they indicate how many different ways one can
 partition the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 into elements of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, the entry for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=12$
\end_inset

 in the table below corresponds to OEIS A079971, which describes the number
 of ways an integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into 1, 2 and 5 (or that 
\begin_inset Formula $5m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into nickels, dimes and quarters).
 This corresponds to the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =11001$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} =\left\{ 1\cdot1,2\cdot1,3\cdot0,4\cdot0,5\cdot1\right\} =\left\{ 1,2,5\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 From such partitions, it appears that one can build partitions of the positive
 integers that are disjoint, and whose union is the positive integers.
 This suggests a question: can these partitions be expressed as Beatty sequences
?

\begin_layout Standard
All of these integer sequences and roots participate in a number of curious
 relations having a regular form; this is, of course, the whole point of
 listing them in the OEIS.
 This suggests a question: do the known relationships generalize to the
 beta-shift setting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the polynomials of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta^{k+1}-\beta-1=0
\]

\end_inset

are the LamÃ© polynomials, they arise as solutions to LamÃ©'s equation, a
 kind of ellipsoidal harmonic differential equation.
 In the present notation, these correspond to polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2^{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example is the Fibonacci-tribonacci-tetranacci sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized golden means
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the roots of the series for which all 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, that is, the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta^{k+1}-\beta^{k}-\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-1=0
\]

\end_inset

In the present notation, these would be the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2^{k}-1$
\end_inset

.
 Such roots can be rapidly computed by a series provided by Hare, Prodinger
 and Shallit
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hare14"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_{k}}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{j}{j\left(k+1\right) \choose j-1}\frac{1}{2^{j\left(k+1\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

This series is obtained by making good use of the Lagrange inversion formula.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th generalized golden mean, i.e.
 the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\alpha_{k}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Can the Hare series be extended to provide the roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for general 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another set of observations seem to invoke the theory of complex multiplication
 on elliptic curves, and pose additional questions.
 So:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tribonacci root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{3}=\frac{1}{3}\left(1+\sqrt[3]{19+3\sqrt{33}}+\sqrt[3]{19-3\sqrt{33}}\right)\simeq1.839\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The silver number (plastic number) 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{8}=\frac{1}{6}\left(\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}+\sqrt[3]{108-12\sqrt{69}}\right)\simeq1.324\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Narayana's cows number 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{2}=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt[3]{116+12\sqrt{93}}+\frac{2}{3\sqrt[3]{116+12\sqrt{93}}}+\frac{1}{3}\simeq1.645\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{6}$
\end_inset

 is related to the silver number 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}=r_{6}\left(r_{6}-1\right)$
\end_inset

 and is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{6}=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}+\frac{2}{\left(\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}\right)^{2}}\simeq1.754\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do the other roots have comparable expressions? To obtain them, is it sufficient
 to articulate the theory of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex multiplication
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on elliptic curves? Are these just disguised solutions to LamÃ©'s ellipsoidal
 harmonic differential equation? The appearance of only the cube and square
 roots is certainly suggestive of an underlying process of points on elliptic
 curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences as shifts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences as shift sequences can be emphasized by noting that
 they arise from the iteration of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k+1\right)\times\left(k+1\right)$
\end_inset

 matrix in lower-Hessenberg form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
b_{0} & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{2} & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots\\
b_{k-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1\\
b_{k} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:golden matrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th element of the sequence is obtained from the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 That such iteration results in integer sequences has long been observed
 in the theory of continued fractions.
 It's useful to work an explicit example.
 For the golden ratio, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and the iterates are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{2}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{3}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
3 & 2\\
2 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{4}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
5 & 3\\
3 & 2
\end{array}\right],\;B^{n}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
F_{n} & F_{n-1}\\
F_{n-1} & F_{n-2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{n}$
\end_inset

 being the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th Fibonacci number, as usual.
 For the general case, after 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge k-1$
\end_inset

 iterations, one gets the symmetric matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{m}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  & \cdots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots\\
F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots &  & F_{m-2k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so that the top row consists of the latest sequence values.
 When multiplied by the bits, this just generates the next iterate in the
 sequence.
 The upper-diagonal 1's just serve to shift columns over by one, with each
 iteration: that is why it's a shift!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is, of course, the polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\left[B-xI\right]=\left(-1\right)^{k}p_{n}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Thus, we can trivially conclude that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are given by the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is in lower-Hessenberg form; this makes it obvious that it's
 a shift; a finite shift, in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equivalent labels for orbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many equivalent ways of labeling the various expressions and propertie
s under consideration.
 These are recapped here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Orbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every given 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

 there is a unique orbit of midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ m_{p}\right\} $
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}=T_{\beta}\left(m_{p-1}\right)=T_{\beta}^{p}\left(m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 The orbits are in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The midpoints are the same as the Renyi-Parry seqence; namely 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{p}\left(\beta/2\right)=\left(\beta/2\right)t_{\beta}^{p}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

, recalling here the notation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta transform"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

.
 Some orbits are periodic (thus, effectively of finite length), while others
 are ergodic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Orbit encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The midpoint generates a unique sequence of bits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},b_{1,},\cdots,b_{k},\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 given by the left-right moves of the mid-point, as it is iterated.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=\Theta\left(m_{k}-1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is one if the midpoint is greater than half, else 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 Each bit-sequence is in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Periodic orbits have finite-length sequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Monotonicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compressor function 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(\beta\right)=\sum_{k}b_{k}2^{-k}$
\end_inset

 is a monotonically increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, so that values of 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Polynomial numbering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1+\left\lfloor \log_{2}\left(2n+1\right)\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 being the length of the orbit.
 The positive real root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=r_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the iteratioin of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 will generate the finite-length bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =\left\{ b_{0},b_{1,},\cdots,b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is in one-to-one correspondence with the bit sequence, and with the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The integer is explicitly given by 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1=\sum_{j=0}^{k}2^{j}b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is not periodic, there is a function 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\zeta^{j+1}$
\end_inset

 holomorphic on the unit disk, having one unique positive real zero 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(r_{\left\{ b\right\} }\right)=0$
\end_inset

 where this 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\left\{ b\right\} }=1/\beta$
\end_inset

 is the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 that generated the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Iterating 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

 generates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 is finite, then 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=\zeta^{k+1}p_{n}\left(1/\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

, so these functions agree on finite-length sequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Brackets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a unique bracketing relationship
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto n\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the polynomial index.
 The left and right bounds 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell,\rho$
\end_inset

 are strictly smaller indexes: 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell<n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho<n$
\end_inset

, and even more strongly, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\ell\le n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\rho\le n$
\end_inset

 that have the property of bounding the positive real roots of the corresponding
 polynomials: 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\ell}<r_{n}<r_{\rho}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\ell}\left(r_{\ell}\right)=p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=p_{\rho}\left(r_{\rho}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Binary tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each bracket is in one-to-one correspondence with a node in the full, unbounded
 binary tree.
 Sub-brackets define left and right subintervals that are disjoint, and
 whose union makes up the whole interval.
 Every node in the full binary tree can be labelled with a unique sequence
 of left-right moves to get to that node.
 This places the brackets (and thus, the polynomials and the roots and the
 mid-point orbits) in unique, one-to-one correspondences with finite-length
 strings of L,R moves.
 Such strings are, in turn, in one-to-one correspondence with the dyadic
 rationals.
 The L,R strings are in one-to-one correspondence with the orbits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 but they are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 numerically the same! This are distinct sequences! In particular, all possible
 L,R moves are allowed.
 Only a limited number of orbits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 are possible, as limited by necklace-counting considerations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Baire sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a unique integer sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 such that the index is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This is a bijection between all valid indexes and all possible finite-length
 sequences.
 Due to the bounding property of the brackets, limits of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

 can be taken, and these limits are unique.
 Thus, all 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values, including those with non-periodic orbits, can be placed in a one-to-one
 bijection with infinite-length sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\in\mathbb{N}^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Beta-Fibonacci sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a sequence of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{\{b\}}$
\end_inset

, the beta-Fibonacci sequence, that is in one-to-one correspondence with
 the finite bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

, and with the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 There are also sequences for each infinite-length orbit 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Shift matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then the finite bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

 defines a lower-Hessenberg 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

golden shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, as shown in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

 can be taken in a relatively straight-forward manner, given below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize: any one of these: the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$

 They are all equivalent labels.

 The extensions are covered in the next two sections.
 The fourth is the numbering

 These are countable; there is no way to extend the counting number

\begin_layout Subsection
Infinite-nacci integer sequences 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci integer sequence can be extended to arbitrary (
\emph on
viz.

\emph default
 infinite) length bit sequences, as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j-1}F_{m-j}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\left\{ b\right\} }=1$
\end_inset

.
 The sum is always finite, but one cannot perform it without first knowing
 at least the first 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bits of the (now infinite) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The integer sequence still has the desirable property it had before: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value is the one associated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, as before, the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 label exactly the same orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarkably, one can be sloppy in how one deals with periodic orbits with
 this extention.
 One has two choices that are equivalent: One choice is to truncate, so
 that the bit-sequence ends with all-zeros, effectively rendering it of
 finite length.
 The alternative is to allow it to continue periodically, forever.
 Either form results in the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequence! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.6$
\end_inset

, which is close to the golden ratio, but not quite.
 It has an infinite non-periodic (non-recurring) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =101010010100101000000100\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The generated integer sequence is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b\}}=1,1,1,2,3,5,8,12,20,32,51,82,130,209,335,535,\cdots$
\end_inset

 which undershoots the Fibonacci sequence (12 appears, where we expected
 13, and 20 instead of 21, and so on).
 The ratio of the last two is 
\begin_inset Formula $535/335=1.597\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the previous is 
\begin_inset Formula $335/209=1.603\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the ratio of successive elements eventually converges to 1.6.
 By comparison, the Fibonacci sequence is generated by the bit-string 1010101010...
 of alternating ones and zeros.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci representation of the orbits has the remarkable property that
 one does not need some 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 mechanism to know if some orbit is periodic or not.
 This dual-representation of periodic orbits is reminiscent of a property
 commonly seen in Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 representations of the real number line, where the dyadic rationals (which
 are countable, of course) map to two distinct bit-sequences (one ending
 in all-ones, the other ending in all-zeros).
 A more general setting for this is given in symbolic dynamics, where the
 totally disconnected Bernoulli scheme 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be used to represent elements of certain countable sets two different
 ways.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10$
\end_inset

, one famously has that 1.000...=0.999...
 as an example.
 So likewise here, one can toggle between finite and infinite-periodic strings.
 So, given a finite string 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which has, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, create a new finite string that is twice as long: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b^{\prime}\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},0,b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which necessarily has exactly the same beta-Fiboanacci sequence.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b^{\prime}\}}=F_{m}^{\{b\}}$
\end_inset

.
 Once can repeat this process 
\emph on
ad infinitum
\emph default
, obtaining an infinite periodic string.
 The difference between these two is simply the difference between a less-than-s
ign, and a less-than-or-equal sign used in the generation of the orbit,
 as noted at the very begining of this chapter.
 We have proven: finite orbits are exactly the same as infinite periodic
 orbits, at least when represented by real numbers and by integer sequences.
 Conversely, the difference between using 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 during iteration is immaterial for describing convergents.

-Polynomials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An infinite polynomial is, of course, an analytic function.
 The goal here is to extend the finite framework.
 The definition of the polynomials above requires a finite bit sequence.
 This can be extended to an asymptotic series, by writing first
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}\left(1-b_{0}z^{-1}-b_{1}z^{-2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{-k-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Set 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/z$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta^{k+1}p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)=1-b_{0}\zeta-b_{1}\zeta^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}\zeta^{k+1}
\]

\end_inset

which extends to the holomorphic function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\zeta^{j+1}
\]

\end_inset

This is manifestly holomorphic on the unit disk, as each coefficient is
 either zero or one.
 It has a positive real zero, of course: 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing to eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"

\end_inset

, we see that this is exactly the same function, or rather, it's negative.
 Indeed, following the definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=d_{n}\left(1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;\zeta\right)=-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

 Of course, one could just declare the matrix elements of the operator to
 be this-and-such, but these matrix elements are with respect to what basis?
 Is the operator even bounded? The answer to the second question is obviously

\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(B-\lambda I\right)=p_{n}\left(\lambda\right)=0$
\end_inset

; the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

 is too large, although the 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1=\left\lfloor \log_{2}n\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 other roots are conveniently arranged near the unit circle, more-or-less
 equidistant from one another.
 The solution is to rescale 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue is now one, and the remaining eigenvalues
 distributed near or on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 We may as well take the transpose as well, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}=B^{T}/\beta$
\end_inset

 is in upper-Hessenberg form.
 Rescaled in this way, it now seems safe to declare, by fiat, that the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the correct extension of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to infinite dimensions.
 Just to be explicit: given the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

, the operator
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has the matrix elements
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle  & =\frac{b_{j}}{\beta}\\
\left\langle j+1\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\beta}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with all other entries being zero.
 This is clearly in upper-Hessenberg form, with the subdiagonal providing
 the shift.
\end_layout

 of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, and the numerical results on it's eigenvalues, it seems clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 must surely be similar.
 That is, there must be an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 such that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\beta}=S^{-1}\mathcal{H}_{\beta}S
\]

\end_inset

The invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho=\rho$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=S\rho$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\sigma=\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the FP-eigenvector.
 It is easy to write down 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 explicitly: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(1,\beta^{-1},\beta^{-2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}=\beta^{-j}$
\end_inset

.
 This is obviously so: the subdiagonal entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 act as a shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and the top row is just
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle \sigma_{j}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\beta^{-j-1}=1-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\right)=1
\]

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is no more solvable than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 in the wavelet basis is, it is certainly much, much easier to work with.
 It also re-affirms the ansatz 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

 for eigenfunctions.
 To be explicit: if 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is a vector satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

, with vector elements 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

, then the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(x\right)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}d_{j}\left(x\right)v_{j}
\]

\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction of the transfer operator: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}v\right]\left(x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, or, explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)+v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)\label{eq:fundamental-shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xfer oper"

\end_inset

.
 So, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, this is just 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\sigma$
\end_inset

 which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, the invariant measure, as always.
 But it also says more: the 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

 are necessarily of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left(1,\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-1},\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, because the subdiagonal forces this shift.
 To satisfy the the top row of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle v_{j}=\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{b_{j}}{\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{j}}=\lambda\left(1-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\frac{1}{\lambda\beta}\right)\right)=\lambda
\]

\end_inset

and so the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is exactly the eigenvalue that solves the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-series 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\lambda\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This effectively concludes a proof: the solutions to this series are the
 only eigenvalues of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transfer operator; there are no others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
The pattern gets repetitive.
 There is no case 
\begin_inset Formula $n=5$
\end_inset

, as this is not one of the allowed orbits.
 The bitstrings are those previously listed in tables; they are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =1001$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =1101$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =1111$
\end_inset

.
 The infinite series is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\cdots\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)/\left(1-\zeta^{4}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The zeros are as previously listed.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4$
\end_inset

 plateuas are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\beta-1}\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\beta, & 1, & \frac{1}{\beta}, & \frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=6$
\end_inset

 plateaus are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\beta}{\beta-1}, & \frac{\beta^{2}}{\left(\beta^{2}-1\right)\left(\beta-1\right)}, & \beta, & \frac{\beta}{\left(\beta^{2}-1\right)\left(\beta-1\right)}\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=7$
\end_inset

 plateaus are at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\beta}{\beta-1}, & \beta, & \frac{\beta+1}{\beta\left(\beta-1\right)}, & \frac{1}{\beta-1}\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Again, the values at the plateaus can be written in many different ways,
 given the finite polynomail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Case n=16
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $n=16$
\end_inset

 polynomial is the first one to have complex zeros inside the unit disk.
 The finite bitstring is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =100001$
\end_inset

 and so the polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ 100001\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\zeta-\zeta^{6}$
\end_inset

.
 The positive real root is 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0.7780895986786\cdots$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1/\zeta=1.28519903324535\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The complex zeros are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0.965709509\cdots\exp\pm i\pi0.2740452363\cdots$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.525107\cdots\pm i0.611100\cdots=0.805718\cdots\exp\pm i\pi0.274045\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding eigenfunction is shown immediately below.

The order of

\end_inset

 is six, and this has six almost-plateaus; they are not quite flat, although
 they are close to it, presumably because 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 is close to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The general case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generalizing from the above, one finds the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a period-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 orbit, the infinite series is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\cdots\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)/\left(1-\zeta^{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first label 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

 has a complex zero within the disk is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=16$
\end_inset

.
 As a general rule, it seems that complex zeros inside the disk only appear
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 (I beleive; have not carefully checked.
 This seems reasonable, as later chapters show that the region of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 behaves very differently from larger values.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The invariant measure has 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 plateaus.
 The plateau boundaries are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\{ 0,\cdots,k-1\right\} $
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

, and so on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The left-most plateau (of the invariant measure) is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/\left(\beta-1\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}1/\beta^{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other plateaus appear to be at simple rational functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, but a precise expression is elusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the last issue, perhaps one can find tools in Galois theory.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]$
\end_inset

 be the ring of polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 and consider the quotient ring 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]/q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a field extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and so one expects a Galois group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Gal}\left(L/\mathbb{R}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The plateaus of the invariant measure are presumably associated with the
 group elements.
 This seems like a promising direction to go in: perhaps this is just enough
 to explain the length of an orbit, the sequence of points in the orbit,
 the reason that some polynomials are forbidden (they don't generate prime
 ideals), the appareance of Moreau's necklace-counting function,
\emph on
 etc
\emph default
.
 This remains an unfinished exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomials factorize.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 denote the real positive root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 â€“ that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then one has the factorizations (dropping the subscript on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for readability)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+r-1\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(x\right)=x-1$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, there are two order-3 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+rp_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

while
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Continuing in this way, there are three order-4 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+p_{3}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+rp_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and (noting that there is no 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}$
\end_inset

 that occurs in the series)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xrp_{0}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's clearly a progression, but perhaps a bit difficult to grasp.
 It can be more clearly seen by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}=q_{2n+1}$
\end_inset

 and then writing out 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

 in binary.
 So, once again, from the top:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=q_{11}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+q_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=q_{1}\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

 which adopts the shorthand that the 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 polynomials on the right-hand side always have 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as an argument, which can be dropped for clarity.
 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\left(r\right)=r$
\end_inset

 was already previously observed, in an earlier section.
 That is, using the dropped-
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 convention, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=r$
\end_inset

.
 Next
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=q_{101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{01}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{01}\left(x\right)\equiv rq_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Next,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=q_{111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{11}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is the second factorization of order 3.
 For order 4, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=q_{1001}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{01}+q_{001}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, this time, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{001}\left(x\right)=xq_{01}\left(x\right)=x^{2}q_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=q_{1101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{011}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{011}\left(x\right)\equiv xq_{11}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=q_{1111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{111}\right)
\]

\end_inset

It is worth doing one more, just to clinch that the reversal of the bit
 sequence is indeed correct.
 For this purpose, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{12}=q_{11001}$
\end_inset

 should serve well.
 One has
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p_{12}\left(x\right)=q_{11001}\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}p_{0}\left(r\right)+x^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)+xrp_{1}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}q_{1}+x^{2}q_{11}+xq_{011}+q_{0011}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general pattern should now be clear.
 Given one of the admissible bit sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}$
\end_inset

 and recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 always, (and that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always) one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1
\]

\end_inset

which has the factorization, with bits reversed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z^{k}+z^{k-1}q_{b_{0}}+z^{k-2}q_{b_{1}b_{0}}+z^{k-3}q_{b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}}+\cdots+q_{b_{k-1}b_{k-2}\cdots b_{1}b_{0}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, as already noted, each 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial in the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Although, notationally, the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 was taken as the real root, the above factorization works for any root.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick can be repeated.
 Although at first it might seem daunting, the pattern is uniform: every
 power of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 occurred in the above.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s\ne r$
\end_inset

 be some other root.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z-s\right)\left(z^{k-1}+\left(s+q_{b_{0}}\right)z^{k-2}+\left(s^{2}+sq_{b_{0}}+q_{b_{o}b_{1}}\right)z^{k-3}+\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

The coefficient of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k-4}$
\end_inset

 term is 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{3}+s^{2}q_{b_{0}}+sq_{b_{o}b_{1}}+q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and so on down the line.
 From this point on, this becomes just an ordinary factorization of polynomials...
 well, but so was the first step, as well.
 What made the first step interesting was that, because the coefficients
 at that first step were explicitly either zero or one, the corresponding
 reversal of the bit sequence became manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may as well bring this detour to a close.
 There's nothing particularly magic in the above factorization, other than
 the combinatorial re-arrangement of the polynomial labels.
 A generic polynomial factorization looks like the below, for comparison.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(x\right)=x^{n+1}+c_{0}x^{n}+c_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots c_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and if 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(r\right)=0$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+\left(r+c_{0}\right)x^{n-1}+\left(r^{2}+c_{0}r+c_{1}\right)x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+a_{0}x^{n-1}+a_{1}x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{k}=r^{k+1}+\sum_{j=0}^{k}c_{j}r^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

So the above works for any polynomial.
 The present case was special since the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 were all either zero or minus one.
 The general form of this factorization is the one associated with the Vandermon
de matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TODO: Perhaps writing down the above as matrix equations will shed some
 insight? Maybe the matrix form will reveal some structure that is hidden,
 when working algebraically?

As may be seen, some of these constants are already notable for various
 reasons.
 Many are also the real roots of yet other polynomials, of a not entirely
 obvious form.
 (Well, the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 polynomials will always be obvious expansions in binomial coefficients).
 The suggestion here is that these are all in turn part of some filigreed
 partially-ordered set of intertwining polynomials.
 Exactly how to express that intertwining in any sort of elegant or insightful
 way is not obvious.

\begin_layout Section
Generating Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-polynomials can be defined via the mask bits 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}$
\end_inset

 or via the orbit summatory function 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Corresponding to each is a unique positive real root 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{n}=r_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 This section takes a very short look at the generating functions for these
 sequences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any sequnce 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

, the ordinary generating function is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{OG}\left(c_{k};z\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}c_{k}z^{k}
\]

\end_inset

The exponential generating function is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{EG}\left(c_{k};z\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}c_{k}\frac{z^{k}}{n!}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical results include 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{OG}\left(\theta_{k};\frac{1}{2}\right)=1.93258880035365\cdots$
\end_inset

 This is not in OEIS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{OG}\left(r_{k};\frac{1}{2}\right)=3.0832181425255\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 This also is not in OEIS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{OG}\left(\psi_{k};\frac{1}{2}\right)=4.14955396300387\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 This also is not in OEIS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploring these visually, on the complex plane, only the EGF is visually
 interesting.
 For both 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

, the EGF shows some randomly, uniformly distributed zeros, showing no particula
r structure.
 Ordinary double precision allows calculations to about 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<800$
\end_inset

 before numeric overflow kills things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EGF for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$
\end_inset

 is much more interesting.
 Here, the zeros are concentrated into rings, and uniformly distributed
 about any given ring.
 A zero-free ray extends along the positive real axis.
 These rings have a radius of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\approx35,55,100,190,350$
\end_inset

 with these figures good to about one-and-a-half digits.
 The rings are wide, and have structure.
 This is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Zeros-EGF"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The rings are presumably due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{n}$
\end_inset

 being concentrated at powers of two, which would be reflected in ring radii
 of 32, 64, 128, 256...
 which is approximately what is seen.

This figure shows the zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{EG}\left(a_{k};z\right)$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane.
 The width of the figure is about 800, so that the outermost circle is at
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\approx350$
\end_inset

.
 The color coding is such that the zeros appear in black, while red denotes
 a large magnitude.
 The asymptotic behavior is very approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mbox{EG}\left(a_{k};z\right)\right|\sim e^{\left|z\right|}/\left|z\right|$
\end_inset

, presumably governed by the asymptotic behavior of Moreau's necklace-counting
 function.
 The ring structure presumably reflects the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 is concentrated just below powers of two.

Inspired by the Lambert series, which arranges poles corresponding to the
 roots of unity along the edge of the unit disk, one may do the same for
 the golden polynomials.
 Thus, define the series
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\theta_{n}\frac{z^{n}}{p_{n}\left(z\right)}
\]

\end_inset

This results in a disk that is sufficiently crazy and unusual, that it is
 worth showing.
 It arranges poles and zeros into nearby pairs, shown in figure

 Note both right-handed and left-handed gradients.
 The left-handed ones are zeros, the right-handed ones are poles.
 It is quite unusual to see such structure.

It is clear that the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Normalization-Integral"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 has some self-similarity properties.
 This section attempts to describe that self-similarity, by identifying
 sequences of discontinuities, and the regions that they bracket.
 This allows a labelling system to be developed for each discontinuity,
 and a bracketing relationship to be given for each self-similar interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always, discontinuities correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values that have periodic orbits, and that each periodic orbit is associated
 with a polynomial

\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=r_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the unique positive real root 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$

 Associated to each polynomial is a mask function

 Discontinuities are associated to indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 endpoints of a self-similar intervals.

The labelling will be for the form of a sequence or string 
\begin_inset Formula $s=\left[m_{1},m_{2},m_{3},\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 of non-negative integers.
 An example is shown in in figure

 The location 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 of the discontinuity will be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\left[\cdots\right]\right)=\beta\left[\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

, sometimes droping parenthesis if the meaning is clear from context.
 Associated to each sequence is an integer index 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\eta\left(\left[\cdots\right]\right)=\eta\left[\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

.
 By definition, indexes get labels if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $1=\theta_{n}$
\end_inset

; the mask function is the final arbiter for the labels.
 By construction, the identity 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\eta\left(s\right)}\left(\beta\left(s\right)\right)=0$
\end_inset

 must hold for all finite strings 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 The task of this section is to expose and describe the bijection between
 the strings 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 and the corresponding indexes

\begin_layout Standard
The development can be extended to infinite-length strings, as well.
 The roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 are dense in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 The mapping of self-similar intervals provided by the bracketing relationship
 guarantees that sequences of intervals converge to a point.
 The labeling system guarantees that all labels within an interval share
 a common prefix with the endpoints.
 Thus, as the prefix gets longer, the bracketed interval gets smaller, convergin
g to a unique limit.
 This is reminiscent of the way in which finite-length continued fractions
 converge to a unique limit.
 However, unlike continued fractions, each finite-length 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 label can be unambiguously associated to one unique infinite-length string.
 As a result, the mapping is a bijection between infinite-length strings
 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathbb{N}^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 in Baire space, and all of the reals in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 This is a true bijection, so one-to-one and onto.
 This is very unlike the situation with continued fractions, which cannot
 represent the rationals with infinite-length strings.
 Continued-fraction mappings have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

holes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the rationals; the beta mapping has no holes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The bracketing relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary task is to exhibit the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta:\mathbb{N}^{<\omega}\to\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

 that maps finite-length strings to indexes.
 This is given through a recursion relation that depends on the index mask
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{n}$
\end_inset

 given previously, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:theta mask"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The mask plays a central role; it encodes information about the polynomials
 and the mid-point orbits; it also encodes the bracketing and self-similarity
 properties of the system.
 All this implies that, in a certain sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is chaotic and ergodic; it captures the complexities of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform in full.
 In particular, this implies that there is no closed-form expression for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

; it can only be defined only recursively, even in principle.

 At the center of the diagram is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi$
\end_inset

, root of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{2}-\beta-1=0$
\end_inset

.
 Reading off the indexes for the main sequence, these are labelled as 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2^{k}=\eta\left[k\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The labelling is defined such that this holds as an identity.
 The label 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[-1\right]$
\end_inset

 will be taken to correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 in upper right of the figure.
 Using a negative number for this point already breaks the idea that the
 labels will consist of non-negative integers.
 Later on, it will be argued that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[-1\right]$
\end_inset

 can be understood as an infinite string of zeros; but, for now, it can
 be treated as a funny special value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seems to be a clear visual correspondence between the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=\beta\left[0\right]<\beta\left[-1\right]=2$
\end_inset

 and the other intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left[k\right]<\beta\left[k-1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 But also it would seem that each of these should correspond to the entire
 interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1=\beta\left[\infty\right]<\beta\left[-1\right]=2$
\end_inset

.
 With this in mind, the largest discontinuity to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

 should correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

 itself: call this discontinuity 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the leader
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the front
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Write the bracketing relationship as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\Mapsto f\Mapsfrom\rho$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with the left and right endpoints of the interval bracketing 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this, several identities emerge: first, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\ell\right)<\beta\left(f\right)<\beta\left(\rho\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It also appears that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\left(\ell\right)<\eta\left(f\right)>\eta\left(\rho\right)$
\end_inset

 will hold, so that the bracketed leader will always have an index greater
 than indexes on either side.
 With this notation, one has the following intervals

From this table, it can be inferred that the recursive sequence index numbering
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\left[0,m\right]=3\cdot2^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to the mask identity 
\begin_inset Formula $1=\theta\left(3\cdot2^{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is sufficient to give a flavor of how bracketing works, and to expose
 an example of index-doubling within a bracketed interval.
 The general form of the bracketing relationship is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\Mapsto\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k+1}\right]\Mapsfrom\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}-1\right]\label{eq:bracketing relation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The case where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}=0$
\end_inset

, resulting in a trailing 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 in the sequence, is handled by means of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parlor trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Sequences with a trailing 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 shorten in length, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\cdots,m,-1\right]=\left[\cdots,m-1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The final comma disappears, and the trailing digit is decremented by one.
 This may seem like a peculiar rule, but is really just a short-hand to
 simplify the notation for the intervals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This perhaps most easily understood by plotting actual 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values for interval endpoints.
 One bracketing relationship is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,0,0\right]\Mapsto\left[1,0,0,0\right]\Mapsfrom\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $42\Mapsto170\Mapsfrom1$
\end_inset

.
 The parlor trick just allows writing the right-hand side as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,0,-1\right]=\left[1,-1\right]=\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

.
 That this is the correct right-hand-side is revealed by plotting 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left[1,0,0\right]=1.60135...<\beta\left[1,0,0,0\right]=1.61193...<\beta\left[0\right]=1.61803...
\]

\end_inset

and observing that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

 is necessarily the right-hand limit for the interval, as there is no other
 appropriate discontinuity for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,0,0,0\right]$
\end_inset

 to be bounded by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is recursive.
 The trailing digit of a sequence always encodes an index doubling.
 This allows a general sequence to be reduced to one with a trailing zero.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},n\right]=2^{n}\eta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},0\right]
\]

\end_inset

The above is written with an explicit 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, which will be dropped from subsequent expressions.
 The context should be clear enough: each bracketed form is in one-to-one
 correspondence with it's integer index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truncating the trailing zero is more difficult; this is where the index
 mask 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 comes to the forefront.
 The recursion rule to truncate the trailing zero is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},0\right]=2^{p}\left(2\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]+1\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the smallest integer for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(2^{p}\left(2\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]+1\right)\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Finding this value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 requires a recursive evaluation of the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Although 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 is necessarily a valid index, by construction, it is not generally the
 case that 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

 is valid.
 The simplest example is 
\begin_inset Formula $4=\eta\left[2\right]$
\end_inset

, for which one has 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot4+1=9$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(9\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 A glance at the earlier table of valid sequences shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(18\right)=0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(36\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and so one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[2,0\right]=2^{2}\left(2\left[2\right]+1\right)=2^{2}\left(2^{3}+1\right)=36$
\end_inset

.
 As luck would have it, this rule generalizes, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[k,0\right]=2^{k}\left(2\left[k\right]+1\right)$
\end_inset

; however, such generalizations are not always possible.
 Recursion is controlled by 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not hard to find many examples for which 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

.
 There are many other examples for which 
\begin_inset Formula $p=m_{1}$
\end_inset

 In yet other cases, one discovers that 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\sum_{i}m_{i}$
\end_inset

 seems to hold.
 However, none of these are general rules; there is no closed-form expression
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This may seem frustrating, but in the end, should not be surprising.
 There is no closed-form expression for the mask function 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 that is not recursive.
 The mask 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 encodes the mid-point orbits; the mid-point orbits encode polynomials;
 the real root of the polynomials equals the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value that is generating that orbit.
 The orbits are in general chaotic, the progress of the mask 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is chaotic as well.
 However, thanks to the recursive defintion of the polynomials given in

 integer 
\begin_inset Formula $p.$
\end_inset

 In general, but not always,

The bracketing relationship allows a simple proof that infinite sequences
 (the non-periodic betas), have a unique convergent.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\beta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 be the root of the polynomial determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This root can be directly computed as the convergent of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequence, as will be demonstrated in an upcoming section.
 The relevant point here is that, as numerical values, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k-1}\right]<\beta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]<\beta\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}-1\right]
\]

\end_inset

The inequalities are strict.
 Thus, any given finite-length sequence is bounded above and below by two
 convergents.
 This allows infinite-length sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 to be defined without ambiguity: they are always bounded above and below,
 by increasingly tight bounds, and so have have a unique convergent.

\end_inset

which can be interpreted as the two points on either end of a discontinuity.These
 identities are meant to be interpreted as the values of limiting sequences.
 For example, for the second identity, on has that, for a 1 followed by
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The continued fraction expansion can be seen to be an odometer that is of
 characteristic zero.
 This is unusual, as odometers are conventionally described in characteristic
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 A quick review of the concept of an odometer is in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An odometer of characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is defined as the set of all infinite-length integer sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 with each 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 drawn from the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
 This set is endowed with a transition function 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 given by the map 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)\mapsto\begin{cases}
\left(a_{0}+1,a_{1},\cdots\right) & \mbox{if }a_{0}\ne p-1\\
\left(0,\cdots,0,a_{k}+1,a_{k+1},\cdots\right) & \mbox{if }\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)=\left(p-1,\cdots,p-1,a_{k},a_{k+1},\cdots\right)
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

That is, it increments 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

 by one, and if that rolls over, then a carry bit is propagated to the next
 term, and so on.
 This is just 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic addition, treated as a dynamical system.
 It can also be interpreted as a map of the unit interval, to itself, when
 the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 is interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{n}a_{n}p^{-n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 As a map of the unit interval, it permutes a countable sequence of intervals
 of decreasing size.

The

\end_inset

-odometer is defined as the bijection that arises by interpreting a sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]$
\end_inset

 either as specifying a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value or a continued fraction.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value is of course, the root of the corresponding polynomial; this root
 can be computed directly, as a convergent of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci series, as shown in a later section.
 The corresponding continued fraction is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\right)=\dfrac{1}{m_{1}+1+\dfrac{1}{m_{2}+1+\dfrac{1}{\cdots}}}
\]

\end_inset

where this differs from the conventional definition, being off-by-one, because
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}$
\end_inset

 can be zero.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the mapping is a bijection is not hard to demonstrate.
 Certainly, for finite-length sequences, continued fractions are rationals;
 each such sequence determines a unique rational, and thus the periodic
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 orbits are mapped to the rationals in this way (thus, the map is an injection).
 Most orbits of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform are not periodic, however; these map to infinitely long sequences
 of bits in the bit expansion.
 The bracketing relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bracketing relation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 guarantees that an infinitely sequence is bounded above and below by pairs
 of finite sequences.
 The bound applies not only to the sequences, but also to the corresponding
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values.
 The bounds are increasingly tight as the sequence lengthens; by standard
 epsilon-delta arguments, the convergent is unique for infinite-length series.
 That is, each distinct non-periodic value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a single, unique infinite sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It is not hard to see that all possible such sequences occur.
 Likewise, every irrational number corresponds to a unique infinite-length
 continued fraction; again, every possible sequence occurs.
 Thus, the odometer provides a bijection between irrationals and non-periodic
 orbits.
 The only difficulty is presented by the rationals: any given rational number
 has several inequivalent continued fraction expansions, and is thus not
 strictly invertable.
 This difficulty is easily swept away by adopting an expansion convention:
 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 by taking the shortest possible continued fraction representation for any
 given rational.
 In this way, one sees that the odometer is a bijection.

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is perhaps a bit cryptic.
 The rationale for this can be clarified by looking at how it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rolls over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The prototypical roll-over occurs at the juncture of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 One observes the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\beta\left[0,1\right] & =1.75488\cdots\\
\beta\left[0,2\right] & =1.70490\cdots\\

\beta\left[0,16\right] & =1.61816\cdots\\
\beta\left[0,N\right] & >\varphi\mbox{ for }N\to\infty\\
\beta\left[0\right]=\beta\left[1,-1\right]=\beta\left[1,0,0,\cdots\right] & =\varphi\\
\beta\left[1,0,0,\cdots,1,\cdots\right] & <\varphi
\end{align*}

\end_inset

That is, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,N\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 rolls over to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,0,0,\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 It is this peculiar behavior that merits the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic case, there is no way to increment the odometer by one unit.
 The best one can do is to write out the expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, decrement by some arbitrarily small 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and notice that the expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 has rolled over at some location.
 The increment is, formally speaking, an infinitesimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be compared to how continued fractions roll over.
 Using our off-by-one notation, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c\left(\left[0,0,N\right]\right)=\dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{1}{N+1}}}=0.5+\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

As the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 is taken, this rolls over to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c\left(\left[1,M\right]\right)=\dfrac{1}{2+\dfrac{1}{M+1}}=0.5-\varepsilon
\]

\end_inset

which rolls over to which is, in a sense, backwards: the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,N\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 does not roll over to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[2,0,0,\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 as one might expect some kind of plausible odometer to do, but instead
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,0,N\right]$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic odometers are interval maps; they re-arrange countable sequences of
 subintervals of the unit interval.
 Here, likewise, the beta odometer rearranges intervals, at least in the
 sense that rearrangements are disjoint.
 So, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)$
\end_inset

 albeit in a fractal manner, and likewise each subinterval bounded by the
 descending series of roots to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{n}-\beta^{n-1}-1=0$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n-1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 By self-symmetry, the sub-intervals will re-arrange as well.

 and the reflection 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{M}\left(x\right)=1-x$

A short aside to refresh our acquaintance with some continued fraction identitie
s.
 Rationals have two inequivalent finite continued-fraction expansions:
\begin_inset Formula

c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},0\right]\right)=c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}+1\right]\right)

\end_inset

If one allows 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

 in an expansion, then one gets a sequence truncation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},\infty,m_{k+2},\cdots\right]\right)=c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

The rollover discussed above corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},0,\infty\right]\right)=c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}+1\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

Defining extended Baire space as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbb{N}\cup\infty\right)^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, then the continued fraction mapping will hit all of the rationals.
 The mapping is not one-to-one, since the first occurence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

 terminates the show, and all strings following this collapse onto the same
 rational.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allowing 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$

 into the mix provides some oddball identies, including a no-op:

In the middle of the string, one gets a drop:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 Any given finite Vandermonde matrix has a non-vanishing determinant, and
 is thus invertable.
 Explicit expressions for the inverse can be readily found on the internet.
 As a general rule, Vandermonde matrices are known to be highly ill-conditioned,
 and difficult to invert numerically.

The shift nature of this can be more directly illustrated.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & \alpha_{0} & \alpha_{0}^{2} & \alpha_{0}^{3} & \cdots\\
1 & \alpha_{1} & \alpha_{1}^{2} & \alpha_{1}^{3} & \cdots\\
1 & \alpha_{2} & \alpha_{2}^{2} & \alpha_{2}^{3} & \cdots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha_{0}\\
\alpha_{1}\\
\alpha_{2}\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Then the above eqn takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Ag=T\alpha=TA\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\\
0\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Presuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertable, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g=A^{-1}TA\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1\\
0\\
\vdots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

So the desired solution picks out one column from a shift that uses a Vandermond
e matrix as the similarity transform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are the iterates of the monomials in a quotient ring.
 So, first of all, the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 are irreducible (over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

; they have one and only one real root; that root is not a rational number).
 The quotient ring 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\left[\beta\right]/f_{n}$
\end_inset

 is thus a field.
 It's also a vector space, spanned by the monomials 
\begin_inset Formula $1,\beta,\beta^{2},\cdots,\beta^{n}$
\end_inset

 as basis vectors, where modulo 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{n+1}=\beta^{n}+1$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, the root 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{n}$
\end_inset

 is an algebraic element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\left[\beta\right]/f_{n}$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{n}$
\end_inset

 is a simple extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

 generated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 states that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\left[\beta\right]/f_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $L_{n}$
\end_inset

 are isomorphic.

What is the orbit of

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

? Numerically, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{n}>1$
\end_inset

, taking its powers will clearly blow up.
 The corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequence is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m+1}^{\left(n\right)}=F_{m}^{\left(n\right)}+F_{m-n}^{\left(n\right)}$
\end_inset

 and so one can immediately write 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{n}^{m}=F_{m}^{\left(n\right)}\varphi_{n}^{n}+F_{m-1}^{\left(n\right)}\varphi_{n}^{n-1}+\cdots+F_{m-n}^{\left(n\right)}\varphi_{n}^{0}$
\end_inset

 as the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{n}^{m}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present case, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}=\varphi_{1}-1=\varphi-1$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}^{2}=1-\alpha_{1}=2-\varphi$
\end_inset

, and onward: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}^{3}=2\alpha_{1}-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}^{4}=2-3\alpha_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}^{5}=5\alpha_{1}-3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}^{6}=5-8\alpha_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so clearly the Fibonacci sequence is showing up.
 For the next row, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{2}^{3}-\varphi_{2}^{2}-1=0$
\end_inset

, and so the second row has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\alpha_{2} & =\varphi_{2}-1\\
\alpha_{2}^{2} & =\varphi_{2}^{2}-2\varphi_{2}+1\\
\alpha_{2}^{3} & =-2\varphi_{2}^{2}+3\varphi_{2}\\
\alpha_{2}^{4} & =3\varphi_{2}^{2}-3\varphi_{2}-2\\
\alpha_{2}^{5} & =-3\varphi_{2}^{2}+\varphi_{2}+5\\
\alpha_{2}^{6} & =\varphi_{2}^{2}+4\varphi_{2}-8\\
\alpha_{2}^{7} & =4\varphi_{2}^{2}-12\varphi_{2}+9\\
\alpha_{2}^{8} & =-12\varphi_{2}^{2}+21\varphi_{2}-5\\
\alpha_{2}^{8} & =21\varphi_{2}^{2}-26\varphi_{2}-7\\
\alpha_{2}^{9} & =-26\varphi_{2}^{2}+19\varphi_{2}+28\\
\alpha_{2}^{10} & =19\varphi_{2}^{2}+9\varphi_{2}-54\\
\alpha_{2}^{11} & =9\varphi_{2}^{2}-63\varphi_{2}+73

I am not enlightened by staring at that.
 Brute force does not appear to work on this.

However, this is ill-conditioned.
 For the matrix

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 seems well-behaved ....
 I guess that means 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is poorly behaved.
 Here, its worse; one has 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\varphi_{n}^{m}$

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n$

 so everything blows up.

\begin_inset Formula $f_{n+1}\left(\beta\right)=\beta f_{n}\left(\beta\right)+\beta-1$

 The ordinary generating function is easy to find:
\begin_inset Formula

 One can now embark down a path of arithmetic.
 For each such polynomial (or analytic series, as the case may be) and given
 some field 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 (for example, say, the rationals 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$

For the case of

 This root is an algebraic element of the polynomial ring 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\left[\beta\right]$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}\left(\varphi_{n}\right)$

 The order of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor \log n\right\rfloor +1$

The idea here can be illustrated explicitly.
 Basically, take the natural sawtooth shape of the map, widen the middle,
 and insert a slanting downward line, to create a zig-zag.
 That is, connect the two endpoints in the middle of the beta shift, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

widening
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 it so that it has a finite, not infinite slope, thereby converting the

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is just a handy notation for a downward sloping line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w=\frac{2x-1}{2\varepsilon}
\]

\end_inset

Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=-1$

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 just smoothly interpolates between +1 and -1 over the middle interval.
 The additional factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{4}-\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)w$
\end_inset

 just serves to insert the downward slope smack into the middle, so that
 the endpoints join up.

 The middle segment is a straight line; it introduces another folding segment

 The sequence of depicted 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 values are the same as in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Islands"

\end_inset

.
 The top row shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0.01,$
\end_inset

 0.02, 0.04, with 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 in the second row and 0.12, 0.14, 0.15 in the
 bottom row.
 The image for 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0$
\end_inset

 is, of course, figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Bifurcation-Diagram"

\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 runs from 1 at the bottom to 2 at the top.
 Working from bottom to top, one can see islands of stability forming in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0.02$
\end_inset

 and 0.04 images.
 The largest island, one third from the top, corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

 the golden ratio.
 Moving downwards, the other prominent islands correspond to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 101, 1001 and 1001, which are the Narayana's Cows number, an un-named number,
 and the Silver Ratio, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.4655\cdots$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 Moving upwards, one can see a faint island at the tribonacci number.
 Due to the general asymmetry of the map, these islands quickly shift away
 from these limiting values.
 For example, the primary island appears to start near 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\delta+\left(2-\delta\right)\left(\varphi-1\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\left(1+2\varepsilon\right)/\left(1-2\varepsilon\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This location is indicated by a horizontal yellow line in the images in
 the right column.
 The other islands shift away in a more complicated fashion.

The 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\beta,\varepsilon}(x)$

 replaces the central segment with a softly-rounded segment, containing
 two critical points: near 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and near 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, where the curve flattens out to a zero slope.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=+1$
\end_inset

, the map as a whole is continuous.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=0.04,$

 The upper row is much like the sequence shown in figure

 The middle row shows the same

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-1$

 The bottom row shows eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-1$
\end_inset

; thus, because 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 gives a straight-line segment in the middle, this bottom row is directly
 comparable to the zig-zap map.
 It should make clear that the islands appear in the middle row due to critical
 points in the S-curve, and not due to the tripartite map.
 The lower right diagram exhibits islands, but only because the middle segment
 has a slope of less than 45 degrees, resulting in a critical point at the
 middle of the map.
 As usual, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 runs from 1 at the bottom to 2 at the top.

 All eight images are held at

 The top row has

.
 As usual, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 runs from 1 at the bottom to 2 at the top.
 In all cases, islands appear, and numerous common features are evident.
 Perhaps most interesting is that the islands do NOT contain period-doubling
 sequences.
 The primary sequence of islands, starting from the central largest, proceeding
 downwards, are located the inverse powers of two, 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\sqrt[k]{2}$
\end_inset

 Why are the islands located at inverse powers of two, instead or, for example,
 the golden means? The short answer: it depends on the location of the kink
 in the map, as explored in the main text.

 The parameter

 The PoincarÃ© recurrence time is obtained by iterating on the maps, and
 then counting how many iterations it takes to get near an earlier point.
 The color coding is such that yellow/red indicates large recurrence times;
 green is intermediate time, blue a short time, and black corresponds to

 less than 3 or 4 or so.
 The vertical black spikes are the Arnold tongues; they correspond to parameter
 regions which lie in an island of stability.
 That is, the recurrance time is low, precisely because the the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The yellow/red regions correspond to chaos, where the iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 is bouncing between all possible values.
 The largest right-most spike is located at

 means (

 As noted earlier, the general curve of that spike appears to follow

\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\left(1+2\varepsilon\right)/\left(1-2\varepsilon\right)$

 The dramatic swallow-tail shapes in the right-hand image are identical

To intuitively understand the location of the islands (the location of the

\end{cases}

\end_inset

As before, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is designed to interpolate appropriately, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\right)=-1$
\end_inset

 The location of the kink is now adjustable: 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Iterating on this map results in figures that are generically similar to
 those of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, except that this time, the location of the islands is controllable by
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 Roughly, to first order, the primary series of islands are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt[k]{2/\left(1-\alpha\right)}$

Thus, the above presents a general surgical technique for controlling both

Conjectures are fun! The above arguments should be sufficient to fully demonstra
te that the circle map, which is well-known to exhibit phase locking regions
 called Arnold tongues, is topologically conjugate to the fattened beta
 shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta,\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
 Or something like that.
 In a certain sense, this can be argued to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solution, via topological conjugacy, of the tent map, the logistic map
 and the circle map.
 This is a worthwhile exercise to actually perform, i.e.
 to give explicit expressions mapping the various regions, as appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, the claim is straight-forward: topologically, all chaotic parts
 of a map correspond to folding (as per Milnor, 1980's on kneading maps),
 into which one may surgically insert regions that have cycles of finite
 length.
 The surgical insertion can occur only at the discontinuities of the kneading
 map.
 It almost sounds trivial, expressed this way; but the algebraic articulation
 of the idea would be worthwhile.

Bergman (Hessenberg) Polynomials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix operator in Hessenberg form, it can be interpreted as a right-shi
ft on the space of polynomials.
 Such polynomials form an orthogonal basis for a certain kind of Hilbert
 space, called the Bergman space.
 They are studied in applied mathematics, as they are orthogonal over some
 measure on the complex plane.
 The Hessenberg operator is a generalization of the better-known case of
 the Jacobi operator, which has it's own extensive theory, including spectra
 and scattering, and is important for several exactly solvable non-linear
 models in physics, including the Toda lattice
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Teschl00"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The Hessenberg operator presumably has an equally rich theory, but it does
 not appear to be currently known; the breadth and scope of existing publication
s is limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general framework for the Hessenberg polynomials is sketched below,
 including a fast and informal definition of Bergman space (the space on
 which the polynomials are orthogonal).
 The Hessenberg matrix is explicitly solvable on the left, and can be explicitly
 brought into a from that exhibits the right-shift operator.
 In the general theory, the change of basis from the shift operator to the
 Hessenberg matrix is known to be the Cholesky decomposition of a moment
 matrix, and specifically, the moments of the measure on which the polynomials
 are orthogonal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two Hessenberg operators in this text: the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 in the wavelet basis, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 generated from the midpoint orbits.
 The second is already obviously a shift, and so everything below follows
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivially
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from it.
 The first form is is numerically and analytically difficult.
 Needless to say, the section below treats the first rather than the second.
 XXX TODO this should be fixed, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is both simpler and more enlightening overall.
 Later ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working backwards from the beta shift, the first asymptotic term in the
 measure can be extracted.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\varphi$

\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 on the complex plane, with a blancmange-like fractal curve giving the weight.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

, it appears to be the derivative of the Dirac delta, with a different blancmang
e-like fractal curve giving the weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bergman Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix operator in Hessenberg form, it can be interpreted as a right-shi
ft on the space of polynomials.
 That is, given an unreduced Hessenberg matrix with matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

, one can write a recurrence relation that defines a sequence of polynomials
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
zp_{n}\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}A_{kn}p_{k}\left(z\right)\label{eq:Hessenberg polynomials}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(z\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 This relation is easily solvable in closed form, as the recurrence relation
 terminates in a finite number of steps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important property of these polynomials is that the zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 correspond to the eigenvalues of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 principle submatrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Numeric exploration of these polynomials confirms the previous results
 on eigenvalues obtained from direct diagonalization: the zeros of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 seems to lie mostly near the circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

, distributed uniformly over all angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all of the sub-diagonal entries obey 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n+1,n}>0$
\end_inset

, then the polynomials form an orthonormal basis for Bergman space.
 That is, there exists a domain in the complex plane on which the polynomials
 provide a basis for a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions on that domain
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Saff12,Tomeo11,Escri11"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 That is, one has the orthogonality relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{mn}=\int_{D}p_{m}\left(\overline{z}\right)p_{n}\left(z\right)d\mu\left(z\right)
\]

\end_inset

for some domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 of the complex plane, and some (Borel) measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu$
\end_inset

 on that domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as an operator with a continuous spectrum.
 To do this, fix a certain, specific value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=c$
\end_inset

 a constant, and then notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is a vector having the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}\vec{p}=z\vec{p}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 is a left-eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

; equivalently, a right-eigenvector of its transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the spectrum is continuous on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix operator 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can also be interpreted as a right-shift on Bergman space.
 To do this, define
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{k}\left(w\right)A_{kn}p_{n}\left(\overline{z}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Then, given some holomorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 decomposed in terms of the polynomials, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=\sum_{n}a_{n}p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

, one has that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[\mathcal{A}f\right]\left(w\right)= & \int\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)f\left(z\right)d\mu\left(z\right)\\
= & \sum_{k}\sum_{n}p_{k}\left(w\right)A_{kn}a_{n}\\
= & w\sum_{n}a_{n}p_{n}\left(w\right)\\
= & wf\left(w\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

That is, given a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, the Hessenberg matrix acts as a right-shift, mapping it to the sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is perhaps a bit silly, as one could instead just perform the same
 manipulation without the 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

, by observing that, formally,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}\left(w,z\right)=w\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{k}\left(w\right)p_{n}\left(\overline{z}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above treatment is breezy and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, paying no heed to summability, convergence or responding to any questions
 about what spaces the various vectors may live in.
 This is as appropriate, since the task here is to discover which spaces
 are the appropriate ones, when the Hessenberg matrix arises from the beta
 shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a bit mis-used, here, as a vague synonym for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite-dimensional matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Properly, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be reserved for an infinite-dimensional matrix acting on some given
 space, having general properties that are independent of the basis chosen
 for that space.
 So far, that might not be the case here: the infinite-dimensional matrices
 here might not be bounded operators; they might not even be continuous,
 viz.
 we have not ruled out the possibility that the space of interest is some
 FrÃ©chet space or some more general topological vector space.
 It is well known that operators on such spaces can have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unexpected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 discontinuities, unexpected in that they are not seen in ordinary Banach
 spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, if polynomials obtained from the beta shift are orthogonal
 on some domain 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 that is the support of some measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu$
\end_inset

, it is not at all clear what this measure might be.
 They are certainly not orthogonal on the unit disk, with uniform measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that the above treatment seems to be a special case of a more
 general principle: when an operator has a continuous spectrum, it can sometimes
 be interpreted as a right-shift.
 That is, given some arbitrary operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, then if one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}f=\lambda f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 takes arbitrary values 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in D\subset\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be a right-shift operator, provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed into a set of orthogonal polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.

Yet, something funny happens on the unit disk.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{m}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 be the polynomials, and for some sequence of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, consider a generic function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}p_{k}\left(z\right)
\]

\end_inset

Consider the case where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a right-eigenvector of the Hessenberg operator, that is, where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_{km}a_{m}=\lambda a_{k}
\]

\end_inset

Substituting into the above, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}A_{km}a_{m}p_{k}\left(z\right)=\frac{z}{\lambda}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}a_{m}p_{m}\left(z\right)=\frac{zf\left(z\right)}{\lambda}
\]

\end_inset

There are two alternatives to solving this; either 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Since this is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, then if 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\lambda$
\end_inset

 is part of the domain of the Bergman space, then one must conclude that
 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)=0$
\end_inset

 everywhere.
 That is, right-eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 correspond to functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 that are vanishing.
 To invent a new name, by analogy to the Fredholm alternative, perhaps this
 can be called the Bergman alternative.

XXX TODO: somewhere just above, or maybe only below, I accidentally swapped

 Thus, almost everything that is written is correct, except that some of
 the transposes are in the wrong places.
 This needs review and correction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose one is given an (arbitrary) sequence of polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

, such that the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $n.$
\end_inset

 Then each individual polynomial can be expanded as or 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\varphi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}p_{nk}z^{k}
\]

\end_inset

This defines an infinite matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}=\left[p_{nk}\right]$
\end_inset

, provided that the coefficients are extended so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nk}=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $k>n$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is manifestly lower-triangular.
 Writing vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{z}=\left(z^{n}\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}=\left(p_{n}\left(z\right)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 as before, the above is just the matrix equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{p}=\mathcal{P}\vec{z}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the case where the polynomials were constructed from some irreducib
le Hessenberg matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The earlier observation that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

 is a shift, namely, that 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}\vec{p}=z\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 can now be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{T}\mathcal{P}\vec{z}=z\mathcal{P}\vec{z}=\mathcal{P}z\vec{z}=\mathcal{PK}\vec{z}
\]

\end_inset

In the above, the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 without the vector notation is just a scalar, and thus commutes (trivially)
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

.
 Its eliminated by explicitly making use of the right-shift (Koopman) operator,
 which, in this basis, is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{K}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ddots
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is lower-triangular, it is invertible on the right, that is, the inverse
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists, and so one is left with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{P}^{-1}A^{T}\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{K}
\]

\end_inset

The irreducibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is important, here; non-zero entries on the sub-diagonal are required,
 else trouble ensues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rearranging, this provides an explicit decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into triangular matrices:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{T}=\mathcal{PKP}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

Taking the transpose, this gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\left[\mathcal{P}^{-1}\right]^{T}\mathcal{K}^{T}\mathcal{P}^{T}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{T}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{P}^{-1}\right]^{T}$
\end_inset

 both being upper-triangular, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}^{T}$
\end_inset

 being the left-shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This system is solvable.
 Given some matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in Hessenberg form, the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 can be computed recursively, in a finite number of steps (i.e.
 in closed form), directly from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Hessenberg polynomials"

\end_inset

.
 The explicit expression is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{n+1,n}p_{n+1,j}=p_{n,j-1}-\sum_{k=0}^{n}A_{kn}p_{kj}
\]

\end_inset

The starting conditions are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{00}=1$
\end_inset

.
 To handle the 
\begin_inset Formula $j=0$
\end_inset

 case in the above, set 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n,-1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is lower triangular, its inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}^{-1}\equiv\mathcal{R}=\left[r_{kn}\right]$
\end_inset

 can be obtained explicitly.
 Along the diagonal, one has 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{nn}=1/p_{nn}$
\end_inset

 while the lower triangular form means 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{kn}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

.
 For the remaining entries 
\begin_inset Formula $m<n$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=\sum_{k=m}^{n}p_{nk}r_{km}
\]

\end_inset

This can be solved in a finite number of iterations on 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{nn}r_{nm}=-\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}p_{nk}r_{km}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above avoids questions of convergence, or any notion of the spaces on
 which the matrices or operators might act.
 The norm to be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 is not specified.
 This is appropriate at this stage: it is the algebraic manipulations that
 are interesting, at this point, rather than the spaces on which the matrices/op
erators might act.
 One can invent several kinds of norms that might be applicable, but there
 is no particular reason to believe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{p}$
\end_inset

 might have a finite norm.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 may not have a finite norm.
 For the case of the Hessenberg operator originating with the beta shift
 operator, it does not; the individual matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nm}$
\end_inset

 increase without bound.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 is an infinite matrix, but it is not clear that it is also an operator.
 If it is, it is certainly not a compact operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the poor behavior can be brought under control by factoring 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{DN}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}$
\end_inset

 being unitriangular (all ones on the diagonal) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 a diagonal matrix, with entries 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{D}\right]_{nk}=p_{nn}\delta_{nk}$
\end_inset

.
 With this factorization, one may then write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{N}^{-1}A^{T}\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 has off-diagonal matrix entries 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{DKD}^{-1}\right]_{nk}=\delta_{n+1,k}p_{nn}/p_{kk}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a rescaling of the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{K}\right]_{nk}=\delta_{n+1,k}$
\end_inset

.
 The scaling factor is exactly the sub-diagonal of the Hessenberg.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{nn}/p_{n+1,n+1}=A_{n+1,n}$
\end_inset

.
 The polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{N}\vec{z}$
\end_inset

 are monic.

One such result is that when

 That is,
\begin_inset Formula

 TODO Write these down.

 so that this is divergent.
 Then write the formal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}=\left[\mathcal{P}^{T}\right]^{-1}\vec{w}$
\end_inset

 which is formally divergent, but can be truncated in finite dimensions,
 and renormalized to be of unit length.
 Doing so provides an eigenfunction of

 The associated eigenvalue is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$

Moment Matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Hessenberg matrix is derived from measures on the complex plane,
 it takes the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{RR}^{T}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{P}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 is the Cholesky decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is manifestly symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Direct observation shows that it is almost positive-definite: one finds
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}>0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 except for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This result can be strengthened: when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}>1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 except for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{0n}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{n0}=1$
\end_inset

 But, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>\varphi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{00}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{01}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{10}=\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{11}=1$
\end_inset

, while all the rest obey 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{ij}<1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the standard literature, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

\end_inset

 for some measure 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Might that be the case here? Taking the time to numerically characterize
 the matrix, one finds that the ratio of successive rows (or columns as
 its symmetric) very quickly approaches a limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{n\to\infty,}\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{nm}/\left[\mathcal{M}\right]_{n-1,m}=C\left(\beta\right)$

\begin_layout Section
The Jacobi Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a Borel measure on the real number line, one can find a sequence of
 polynomials that are orthonormal with respect to that measure.
 These polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 are coupled together by a three-term recurrence equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
xp_{n}\left(x\right)=a_{n+1}p_{n+1}\left(x\right)+b_{n}p_{n}\left(x\right)+a_{n}p_{n-1}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{-1}\left(x\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This recurrence relation can be taken to be an operator, known as the Jacobi
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}$
\end_inset

, acting on vectors consisting of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x\right)=\left\{ p_{n}\left(x\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{J}p\right]\left(x\right)=xp\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{J}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The two sequences of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 form three diagonals of the operator, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 running down the center, and

\begin_layout Subsection
Moments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Construction of the polynomial sequences require moments.
 Since the invariant measures (and all of the eigenfunctions) are linear
 combinations of the Hessenberg basis functions, it suffices to compute
 the moments for these.
 Since the basis functions are piece-wise constant, and have an explicit
 expression given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Hess-Haar-basis-fn"

\end_inset

, the moments can also be given explicit expression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{0}^{1}x^{n-1}\psi_{p}\left(x\right)dx=\frac{C_{p}}{n}\left[\frac{m_{p}^{n}-m_{l}^{n}}{m_{p}-m_{l}}-\frac{m_{u}^{n}-m_{p}^{n}}{m_{u}-m_{p}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

with the midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}$
\end_inset

 and the lower and upper midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{l}<m_{p}<m_{u}$
\end_inset

 defined just as before.
 Clearly, the moments rapidly get small as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, these also rapidly get small as 
\begin_inset Formula $p\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Multiplication Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulties presented in the previous section suggests that studying
 the multiplication operator might be simpler.
 Multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\label{eq:multiplication}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The corresponding transfer operator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The multiplication operator, superficially, in itself, is not terribly interesti
ng; it simply rescales things.
 It does not generate fractals, at least, not if one confines oneself to
 real numbers and the canonical topology on the real-number line.
 If instead one works with the product topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, then the multiplication operator becomes rather complicated and difficult
 to analyze.
 In this sense, it is promising: it avoids the overt complexity of the logistic
 map, the tent map and the beta shift, yet still has a complicated behavior
 in the product topology.
 In particular, the multiplication of two numbers appear to involve chaotic
 dynamics of the carry bit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta-shift, Revisited
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

 takes a simple form when reinterpreted on bit-strings: it is the concatenation
 of multiplication, followed by a left-shift.
 Given a bit-string 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b_{n}\right)=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots$
\end_inset

 denote its left-shift by 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\left(0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots\right)=0.b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset

which, for real numbers, corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U(x)=\begin{cases}
2x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2x-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

which is none-other than the Bernoulli shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli shift"

\end_inset

 with a change of notation.
 The beta shift is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}\left(x\right)=M_{\beta}\left(U\left(x\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the iterated beta shift is an alternation between a left-shift and
 a multiplication.
 The act of discarding the most significant bit (the MSB) with each left-shift
 alters the dynamics of iterated multiplication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests that studying multiplication and the multiplication operator
 might provide fruitful insight into the beta shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Monomial Eigenfunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some properties of the multiplication operator can be guessed at directly.
 Obviously, 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 is a decaying/growing eigenfunction, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

 or not.
 That is, one should imagine 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\mbox{const.}$
\end_inset

 as a uniform distribution of dust; with each iteration, it is spread either
 farther apart (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

) or bunched closer together (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=x^{n}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction, with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta^{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 If one considers multiplication only to operate on the positive real-number
 line, then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 need not be an integer.
 In other words, the multiplication operator has a continuous spectrum in
 this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the domain of the operator is extended to functions on the non-negative
 real-number line, then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 must be positive, as otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(0\right)$
\end_inset

 is ill-defined.
 But if 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is positive, then (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

) the multiplication operator only has eigenvalues greater than one, which
 is not, in general, very desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the domain of the multiplication operator is extended to the entire real-numb
er line, then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is forced to be an integer, in order to avoid issues due to multi-valued
 functions.
 Extending the domain to the complex plane leads us astray, and so we will
 not go there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A Fractal Eigenfunction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compressor function is also an eigenfunction.
 It was previously observed in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:compressor self-sim"

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<1$
\end_inset

 and so, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is potentially be an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2\beta$
\end_inset

, provided that it is extended to arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $1<x$
\end_inset

.
 This can be done as follows.
 Define the extended function, valid for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\infty$
\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{ecpr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(x\right) & \mbox{if }0\le2x<\beta\\
2\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right) & \mbox{if }\beta\le2x<\beta^{2}\\
4\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{\beta^{2}}\right) & \mbox{if }\beta^{2}\le2x<\beta^{3}\\
2^{n}\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(\frac{x}{\beta^{n}}\right) & \mbox{if }\beta^{n}\le2x<\beta^{n+1}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The extension is performed simply by treating the self-similarity as a recurrenc
e relation, which can be iterated to move the argument into a region where
 the original definition was sufficient.
 In essence, one applies a right-shift operator to reduce the argument.
 Since the multiplication operator is odd about 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, on can trivially extend this to negative 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{ecpr}_{\beta}\left(-x\right)=-\mbox{ecpr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the original 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 also had a translation symmetry: the upper half was equal to the lower
 half.
 This translation symmetry has been lost, since after all, multiplication
 does not preserve translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ecpr function is not square integrable; it does not have an 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{p}$
\end_inset

-norm for any 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

; and this is no surprise, as its hard to imagine how it could be otherwise,
 for a function to be self-similar under scaling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A Generic log-periodic Eigenfunction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inspired by the above, its should be clear how to build a generic eigenfunction.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 be some arbitrary function, defined on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le x<\beta$
\end_inset

 (given some fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta$
\end_inset

).
 Define its extension as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{w}^{\prime}\left(x\right)=w^{n}g\left(\frac{x}{\beta^{n}}\right)\;\mbox{ if }\beta^{n}\le x<\beta^{n+1}
\]

\end_inset

This has, by construction, the self-similarity relation 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{w}^{\prime}\left(\beta x\right)=wg_{w}^{\prime}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and so is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $w/\beta$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}g_{w}^{\prime}\right]=\frac{w}{\beta}g_{w}^{\prime}
\]

\end_inset

This function is merely log-periodic; its not fractal.
 Perhaps its silly to illustrate this; it should be obvious, but just in
 case its not, the figure below shows such a function, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0.8$
\end_inset

.
 It is an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{1.6}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue of 1/2.

\align left
There doesn't seem to be anything particularly interesting with this particular
 game.
 There's a simple explanation for this: The multiplication operator is generatin
g a free monoid in one generator (the iteration itself), whereas fractals
 require at least two generators of self-symmetry.
 The (usually) free interaction of multiple generators is what forces the
 fractal to appear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{cpr}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 function constructed above is a special case of this: It's self-similar,
 but the property that made it interesting, as a fractal, was erased in
 the construction.
 As before, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{w}^{\prime}\left(x^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta w^{n}$
\end_inset

 (for integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsection
Haar Basis Matrix Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Haar basis matrix elements for the beta shift proved to be a bit unwieldy
 and not terribly useful.
 The corresponding matrix elements for the multiplication operator have
 the same general essence, but are slightly simpler and shorter to write
 down.
 In all other respects, they still have the same tractability issues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multiplication operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has matrix elements in the standard Haar basis:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left\langle mi\left|{\cal M}_{\beta}\right|nj\right\rangle = & \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h_{mi}\left(x\right)\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}h_{nj}\right]\left(x\right)dx\\
= & \frac{2^{\left(m+n\right)/2}}{\beta}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h\left(2^{m}x-i\right)h\left(\frac{2^{n}x}{\beta}-j\right)dx
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Instead of confining oneself to the unit interval, here it is convenient
 to consider the entire real-number line, and thus that is the range of
 the integral.
 Likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 an be any integers, positive or negative.
 As before, matrix elements vanish unless 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\frac{i}{2^{m}},\frac{i+1}{2^{m}}\right]\cap\left[\frac{\beta j}{2^{n}},\frac{\beta\left(j+1\right)}{2^{n}}\right]\ne\emptyset
\]

\end_inset

This holds in three cases: where one of the intervals contains an edge transitio
n (left, middle or right) of the other interval, without also containing
 the other two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Shift and Add algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can model the multiplication of real numbers with a number of different
 algorithms applied to bit strings.
 One of the simplest such algorithms is the shift-and-add algorithm, described
 here.
 Its just elementary-school long-form multiplication, applied to the binary
 expansions of the numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a point worth laboring on: a bit string representing a real number
 is not the same thing as the real number.
 There are more bit-strings than there are real numbers.
 Most famously, the two bit strings 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0111\cdots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1000\cdots$
\end_inset

 are two obviously distinct bit-strings, but they represent the same real
 number: one-half.
 All real numbers of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $j/2^{n}$
\end_inset

 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dyadic rationals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) will always have dual representations; all other real numbers have a single,
 unique representation.
 These correspond to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaps
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the Cantor set, or, equivalently, neighboring infinite branches in the
 finite binary tree.
 Bit-strings are not real numbers.
 They're just a usable model of them.
 The usability is somewhat limited; its OK for working with individual points,
 but fails miserably for the topologies: the canonical topology on the reals
 is sharply different than the product topology on 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal is to compute the product 
\begin_inset Formula $Kx$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le K\le1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 so that the product is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le Kx\le1$
\end_inset

.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are represented by their binary expansions.
 Let the binary expansions be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{-n-1}
\]

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=0.c_{0}c_{1}c_{2}\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}2^{-n-1}
\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 are either 0 or 1, always.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 to be the non-negative integer
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s_{n+1}=b_{n}c_{0}+b_{n-1}c_{1}+\cdots+b_{0}c_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}c_{n-k}\label{eq:carry-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le s_{n}\le n$
\end_inset

.
 It is useful to visualize this in terms of the elementary school shifted
 tabular form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\begin{array}{cccccc}
0 & c_{0}b_{0} & c_{0}b_{1} & c_{0}b_{2} & c_{0}b_{3} & \cdots\\
 &  & c_{1}b_{0} & c_{1}b_{1} & c_{1}b_{2} & \cdots\\
 &  &  & c_{2}b_{0} & c_{2}b_{1} & \cdots\\
+ &  &  &  & c_{3}b_{0} & \cdots
\end{array}\\
\mbox{--------------------------------------------}\\
\begin{array}{cccccc}
s_{0}\;\; & \;s_{1}\;\; & \;s_{2}\;\; & \;\;s_{3}\;\; & \;\;s_{4}\;\;\; & \cdots\end{array}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 This makes clear the shift-and-add form.
 The value of each individual 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be visualized as a stack of blocks.
 For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $K=0.111\cdots=1$
\end_inset

 one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}$
\end_inset

, that is, it is simply the total number of one-bits in the first 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final step is to reduce the the sum series 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset

 to a bit-string.
 This is accomplished recursively, by performing a carry operation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d_{n}=s_{n}+\left\lfloor \frac{d_{n+1}}{2}\right\rfloor \label{eq:propagate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor d\right\rfloor =d\mod1$
\end_inset

 denotes the floor of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 (the integer part of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

).
 The desired bit sequence is then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{n}=d_{n}\mod\,2\label{eq:remainder}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the remainder, the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 that was not propagated to the next location.
 Explicitly, is is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}=d_{n}-2\left\lfloor d_{n}/2\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 The carry-sum propagation can be imagined as a kind of bulldozer, razing
 the towers 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 until they are one block high, pushing the razed bits off to the next location.
 The resulting sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 is then the bit-string for the product 
\begin_inset Formula $Kx$
\end_inset

.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Kx=0.a_{0}a_{1}a_{2}\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}2^{-n-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this algorithm is that the relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:propagate"

\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 is infinitely recursive, and in general is not guaranteed to terminate.
 One has to start at 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\infty$
\end_inset

 and move backwards from there.
 There are two plausible scenarios for computing the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 in practice.
 One is to search the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 until one finds that spot where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lfloor d_{N+1}/2\right\rfloor =0$
\end_inset

; one can then obtain the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n<N$
\end_inset

 without issue.
 The problem here is to find such an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_layout Standard
The other way to compute is to observe that the iteration is convergent.
 The recursion 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:propagate"

\end_inset

 only depends on a finite and fixed number of bits 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

behind it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, roughly equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}n$
\end_inset

 bits that come after this.
 As noted earlier, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le s_{n}\le n$
\end_inset

 and likewise, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le d_{n}\le2n+1$
\end_inset

.
 To write down 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

, one needs at most 
\begin_inset Formula $C=1+\left\lfloor \log_{2}\left(2n+1\right)\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 bits.
 This implies that a given 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 can only perturb at most 
\begin_inset Formula $C-1$
\end_inset

 bits downstream of it.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n-C+1}$
\end_inset

 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n-C}$
\end_inset

 does not.
 Thus, in order to correctly compute all bits 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le k\le n-C$
\end_inset

, it is sufficient to set 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 to some arbitrary value (less than 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+2$
\end_inset

) and then iterate (using the correct values for 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{k}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k<n$
\end_inset

).
 At the end, discard all 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n-C<k$
\end_inset

, as they are incorrect.

\begin_layout Section
Simplified Models of Multiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shift-and-add algorithm is obviously rather complex; can it be replaced
 by something simpler? The particular question to ask is how much of the
 chaotic dynamics of the beta shift is due to the propagation of the carry
 bit, and how much of it is due to other parts of the algorithm? Specifically,
 the addition of two numbers, which requires a carry bit, can be replaced
 by a bit-wise XOR of their bit strings: this generates 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the same results as addition, when the number of 1-bits in the strings
 are sparse, but are wrong when 1-bits appear in the same location: the
 XOR discards the carry bits.
 Thus, a simplified model of multiplication would the the shift-and-XOR
 model: it proceeds the same way as shift-and-add, but replaces addition
 with XOR.
 What does this look like, and how does the equivalent of the beta shift
 behave under this operation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shift-and-XOR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shift-and-XOR algorithm must like the shift-and-add algorithm, except
 that it drops the carry bits.
 Starting from the same spot, let 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le K\le1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 and represent both by their binary expansions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}2^{-n-1}
\]

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=0.c_{0}c_{1}c_{2}\cdots=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}2^{-n-1}
\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}$
\end_inset

 are either 0 or 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 to be the result of XOR-ing instead of adding the bits.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{n+1}=b_{n}c_{0}\oplus b_{n-1}c_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus b_{0}c_{n}=\bigoplus_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}c_{n-k}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the oplus symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\oplus$
\end_inset

 denotes the XOR operation.
 Note that each 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset

 is either zero or one.
 Reconstructing a real number from this, one defines
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K\otimes x=0.s_{0}s_{1}s_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset

where the otimes symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 is pressed into service to indicate the shift-and-XOR product.
 Note that it is symmetric: 
\begin_inset Formula $K\otimes x=x\otimes K$
\end_inset

 and so behaves at least a bit like ordinary multiplication.
 Its is not distributive over ordinary addition: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a+b\right)\otimes x\ne a\otimes x+b\otimes x$
\end_inset

 but it is distributive over XOR: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\oplus b\right)\otimes x=\left(a\otimes x\right)\oplus\left(b\otimes x\right)$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The range of the shift-and-XOR operation is fundamentally different from
 multiplication.
 First, because the carry bit is dropped, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 always, and so that 
\begin_inset Formula $K\otimes x\le1/2$
\end_inset

 always, even when both 
\begin_inset Formula $K\to1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to1$
\end_inset

.
 Next, for any value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<K\le1$
\end_inset

, the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $K\otimes x$
\end_inset

 runs over the entire interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1/2]$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 runs over the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 The measure is not compressed (other than by a factor of 2) , as there
 is in ordinary multiplication.
 That is, if 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 is a measurable subset of the unit interval, with measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(S\right)$
\end_inset

, then one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(K\otimes S\right)=\mu\left(S\right)/2$
\end_inset

.
 There are several ways to prove this.
 One formal approach is to consider the correspondence between the natural
 measure on the reals, and the measure of cylinder sets on the product topology.
 That is, the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is endowed with a natural topology, the product topology.
 The open sets of this topology are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Their measure is uniformly distributed over unit interval, precisely because
 the Bernoulli shift is ergodic: the one implies the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the shift-and-XOR algorithm can be best thought of as a formula
 for shuffling the bit-strings around, without actually altering them: re-orderi
ng them, not changing them.
 The intuitive key to this is to observe that subtracting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from 1 just re-orders the unit interval, top to bottom, and that this is
 the same as flipping all zero bits to one, and v.v.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $1-x=x\oplus0.111\cdots$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to see this shuffling is to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\oplus a=0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $0\oplus x=x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, the string 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the string 
\begin_inset Formula $a\oplus x$
\end_inset

 are paired together, in a unique way, so that either can be gotten from
 the other.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $a\oplus[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

 sending 
\begin_inset Formula $x\mapsto a\oplus x$
\end_inset

 is an exchange of these unique pairings of strings.
 It is not just a bijection, it is an involution.
 If the strings are given their natural lexicographic sort order, the mapping
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\mapsto a\oplus x$
\end_inset

 is just a certain kind of shuffle of the sort order; it neither adds new
 strings, nor deletes any, nor changes their number.
 The function is one-to-one and onto.
 The multiply-and-XOR algorithm is just a repeated sequence of XOR's: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K\otimes x=\left(\frac{c_{0}x}{2}\right)\oplus\left(\frac{c_{1}x}{4}\right)\oplus\left(\frac{c_{2}x}{8}\right)\oplus\cdots
\]

\end_inset

and so 
\begin_inset Formula $K\otimes x$
\end_inset

 is nothing more than a reshuffling of strings (along with a right-shift
 equal to the number of leading zero-bits in the binary expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

; the right-shift commutes with the measure on the product topology.) Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $K\otimes x$
\end_inset

 preserves the measure on the unit interval (up to a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

 due to the above-mentioned right-shift).
 That is, for 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<K\le1$
\end_inset

, this discussion shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(K\otimes S\right)=\mu\left(S\right)/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Self-similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several self-similarity properties of the shift-XOR worth noting.
 It behaves very much like a classic dyadic fractal.
 Thus, one has that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K\otimes\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(K\otimes x\right)=\frac{1}{2}K\otimes x
\]

\end_inset

In addition...
 TODO: illustrate the other symmetry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Similarity Transformations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shift-and-XOR algorithm acts as a permutation on bit-strings.
 As a result, the XOR-analogs of the beta shift and the tent map become
 uniformly ergodic, behaving exactly as the Bernoulli shift.
 The Frobenius-Perron solution to these is just the uniform distribution,
 which is featureless.
 All of the structure visible in figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Bifurcation-Diagram"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tent-Map-Bifur"

\end_inset

 is entirely due to the dynamics of the carry bit.
 Effectively, the carry-bit algorithm alters the uniform distribution of
 the Bernoulli shift (equivalently, the uniform distribution associated
 with the natural measure on Cantor space.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define the XOR-analog of the beta shift as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
2\beta\otimes x & \mbox{for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2\beta\otimes\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{for }\frac{1}{2}\le x<1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The factor of 2 makes up for the fact that shift-XOR effectively drops the
 top bit; thus the goal is to map each half of the unit interval into the
 entire interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, define 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes_{\beta}:\left[0,1\right]\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boxtimes_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta\otimes x
\]

\end_inset

As observed previously, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is an automorphism of the unit interval, and more: it is a permutation
 on Cantor space.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $b(x)$
\end_inset

 be the Bernoulli shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bernoulli shift"

\end_inset

; then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\beta}=\boxtimes_{\beta}\circ b$
\end_inset

.
 Taken together, this implies that the ergodic properties of iterating on
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 follow directly from the ergodic properties of the Bernoulli shift; a shuffle,
 any shuffle on the Cantor set should not alter these ergodic properties.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tent-Map-Bifur"

\end_inset

 is entirely due to the dynamics of the propagation of the carry sum.
 To explore this, the notation needs to be improved on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift can be decomposed into multiple distinct stages.
 First, there is a conversion from the unit interval to the Cantor space;
 this was defined at the very start, but now we need a less awkward notation
 for it.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\pi:2^{\omega} & \to & \left[0,1\right]\\
0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots & \mapsto & x
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

be the projection from the Cantor space to the real-number unit interval,
 given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:bernoulli-bits"

\end_inset

.
 Note that it is a surjection: dyadic rationals (rationals of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $m/2^{n}$
\end_inset

) correspond to two distinct bit strings.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 can be represented as both 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1000\cdots$
\end_inset

 and as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0111\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 Cantor space covers the unit interval.
 Write the inverse mapping as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\pi^{-1}:\left[0,1\right] & \to & 2^{\omega}\\
x & \mapsto & 0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

As a function, it is injective but not surjective.
 It is usually convenient to ignore this, and to pretend that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{-1}$
\end_inset

 are bijections, even though they are not.
 This rarely leads to practical difficulties, as long as one stays conceptually
 tidy.
 Better yet, just perform all work on the Cantor space, and project to the
 unit interval only when needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, turn to multiplication.
 This has three parts.
 First, the summation of the carry bits: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
S_{\beta}:2^{\omega} & \to & \mathbb{N}^{\omega}\\
0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots & \mapsto & \left(s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},\cdots\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

where the summation is given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:carry-bits"

\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is Baire space, the space of all infinite-length sequences of non-negative
 integers.
 In number theory, this would be called the space of arithmetic functions.
 The second part of multiplication is the propagation of the carry bits.
 Denote this as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
C:\mathbb{N}^{\omega} & \to & \mathbb{N}^{\omega}\\
\left(s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},\cdots\right) & \mapsto & \left(d_{0},d_{1},d_{2},\cdots\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

which is defined in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:propagate"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, one extracts the remainder, after propagation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
A:\mathbb{N}^{\omega} & \to & 2^{\omega}\\
\left(d_{0},d_{1},d_{2},\cdots\right) & \mapsto & \left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\cdots\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

which is given by eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:remainder"

\end_inset

.
 Of the three parts into which we've decomposed multiplication, only the
 first part is parameterized by 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, multiplication, on Cantor space, can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\beta}=A\circ C\circ S_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 The shift-and-XOR algorithm omits the propagation of the carry sum.
 On Cantor space, it is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes_{\beta}=A\circ S_{\beta}$
\end_inset

: the XOR is just modulo-2 of the carry sum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain multiplication on the real-number unit interval, we need merely
 to re-project from Cantor space to the reals.
 Thus, multiplication, given in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:multiplication"

\end_inset

, decomposes into
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{\beta}=\pi\circ A\circ C\circ S_{\beta}\circ\pi^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

The beta shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}=\pi\circ A\circ C\circ S_{\beta}\circ\pi^{-1}\circ b
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is the Bernoulli shift.
 To simplify notation, it is convenient to go ahead and provide a symbol
 for the shift operator:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
B:2^{\omega} & \to & 2^{\omega}\\
\left(b_{0},b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right) & \mapsto & \left(b_{1},b_{2},\cdots\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\pi\circ B\circ\pi^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding beta shift on the Cantor space is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{\beta}=A\circ C\circ S_{\beta}\circ B
\]

\end_inset

which eliminates the pesky projection 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 It should be clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is an injection, the propagation operation 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and the remainder 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are both surjections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted, the shift-and-XOR algorithm can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\boxtimes_{\beta}=A\circ S_{\beta}$
\end_inset

; the step where the carry bits are propagated is dropped.
 The XOR-version of the beta shift is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{\beta}=\boxtimes_{\beta}\circ B=A\circ S_{\beta}\circ B
\]

\end_inset

Thus, in this new notation, it reaffirms that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the true source of ergodicity, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\circ S_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 being a permutation does not alter the basic ergodic property of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 All of the structure in the bifurcation diagrams can be blamed on the propagati

Reviewing the images there makes it clear that although fiddling with the
 carry bit fundamentally alters point trajectories, it completely fails
 to open any doors that would provide insight into the structure of the
 transfer operator.
 The pictures are pretty, but appear to be meaningless.

Sci-fi day-dreaming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides two day-dreams inspired by this material.
 They are just that: daydreams.
 If you don't like fictional daydreaming, you won't like the material here.
 Sorry about that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limits to computation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many limits to computation.
 One limit is the speed of light.
 In current generation CPU chips, clock rates in the vicinity of 3 gigahertz
\begin_inset Formula $=3\times10^{9}$
\end_inset

 cycles per second.
 By comparison, the speed of light in a vacuum is about 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 meters per second.
 Dividing, one finds that light can travel about 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times10^{8}/3\times10^{9}=10^{-1}$
\end_inset

 meters, or about four inches: a bit bigger than the actual physical dimensions
 of a chip (typically around half-an-inch on a side), but not by much.
 Of course, the speed of light in a metal conductor is lower â€“ about half
 the speed in a vacuum.
 And transistors are small â€“ more than twenty-thousand times smaller.
 So, measured in terms of the size of the transistor, the speed of light
 is about ten or twenty transistor-widths per clock-cycle.
 So, OK, its still fast, at that length scale.
 But not really all that fast.
 The point here is that the speed of light is a potential limit to the speed
 of computation, and it is not all that far away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this setting, one can imagine the situation where the speed of propagating
 the carry bit during multiplication becomes a limiting factor.
 The above work hints at a somewhat mind-boggling idea: can multiplication
 be effectively parallelized by working with transfer operators instead?
 That is, the multiplication of two numbers corresponds to point-wise particle
 dynamics: a discrete particle following a chaotic path through a complex
 numerical computation.
 By contrast, the transfer operator describes how a distribution propagates
 through a computation: it effectively performs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an infinite number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of multiplications at the same time, in parallel.
 That is, rather than asking how single values propagate, one could, and
 perhaps should, ask how distributions propagate â€“ parallelize multiplication
 (for example) to an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 degree.
 It is this rather ridiculous idea that suggests that the above explorations
 are not purely abstract, but have a potentially practical application.
 As I suggested â€“ its a bit of science-fiction day-dreaming at this point.
 But it does hint at an alternate model of computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variants of this model have already been explored, for decades.
 For example, Crutchfeld defined 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

geometric state machines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as generalizations of finite state machines, where, instead of having a
 finite matrix (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transition matrix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) act on a finite vector (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

state vector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), one instead considers operators acting on homogeneous spaces â€“ that is,
 applying a sequence of such operators on homogeneous space.
 The most famous and celebrated such space would the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 â€“ complex projective space, with the operators that act on it being the
 the unitary ones: 
\begin_inset Formula $U(n)$
\end_inset

 â€“ such a system defining the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-qubit quantum state machine.
 Distributions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$
\end_inset

 are mixed states â€“ and the idea of quantum computing is to evolve such
 states through a set of operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that ALL quantum computing can be understood to be nothing more than
 a Crutchfeld machine.
 For whatever reason, this is almost never stated outright.
 This is unfortunate, since the Crutchfeld machine is quite easy to understand,
 whereas 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum computing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems to be mired in mystery, at least for the uninitiated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point here is that computation, by means of the time-like evolution
 of distributional densities, is already being explored, but in a rather
 different context than the one explored here.
 Here, it seems like we are bowled over by the complexities of a seemingly
 much simpler system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wave function collapse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a different, bizarrely hypothetical way in which all of this
 apparatus could manifest itself.
 Currently, in order to avoid the rather severe issues associated with the
 concept of quantum-mechanical wave-function collapse, the (vast?) majority
 of practicing physicists believe in the many-worlds hypothesis.
 Clearly, this belief is entirely correct for microscopic systems, isolated
 from the usual thermodynamic hustle and bustle (chlorophyll, rhodopsin
 and the magnetically sensitive cryptochromes notwithstanding).
 But it seems to fly in the face of daily experience, where we are aware
 of just one reality.
 One of my favorite hypotheses is that this is the result of the (rapid)
 decay of macroscopic quantum states down to a probability of zero.
 The mechanism is presumably that of decaying subshift measures.
 Penrose argues that this has something to do with gravity; but we can go
 one better: the natural setting for shift spaces are hyperbolic spaces,
 as that is where there is enough room to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fit everything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a uniform way consistent with a metric.
 Curiously, the world we live in â€“ Minkowski space, is hyperbolic.
 This suggests that the Many Worlds interpretation is exactly right, as
 long as one truly is in Minkowski space, but that gravitation, which essentiall
y bends or distorts it, squeezes down the room available for multiple quantum
 states, effectively forcing the collapse in this way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put another way: the standard treatment for quantum field theory is the
 Feynman functional integral; it can be viewed as an integral over all possible
 paths that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

particle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might take.
 The daydream is to equate a specific path with the idea of point-dynamics
 in an iterated function.
 As long as one considers only points, and thier movement, one can be completely
 unaware of either the invariant measure, or of the decaying eigenstates
 of the shift operator.
 In a standard QFT textbook, all equations appear microscopically time-reversibl
e.
 There's almost no idea of a measure, except for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp-i\hbar S$
\end_inset

 in the Feynman integral.
 The incorporation of gravity into this is famously difficult.
 The daydream here is that gravity manifests itself as eigenfunctions that
 live off of the shell of unitary evolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some practical hope of bringing this daydream to fruition: the
 theory of subshifts has seen dramatic advances over the last few decades,
 getting increasingly abstract, and gaining a firm footing in very general
 settings: viz not just in metric spaces, but even in more general topological
 vector spaces, and specifically in stereotype spaces, where most of the
 devices used in analysis can be exercised in reasonably safe manner.
 The point here is that most of QFT can be formulated using these more-or-less
 conventional tools and notations.
 The trick is to locate and extract those parts that renormalize to zero,
 not unlike some of the formally divergent sums explored above, which can
 none-the-less be regulated and made to give reasonable answers.
 Or at least, that's the daydream.
 Clearly, got far to got before it can be reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Topological Push-Forward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator is most generally and correctly defined as an operator
 acting on the topology of a space, and specifically, as the push-forward
 of the (uniform) measure by the iterated function.
 That is, given any open set belonging to the topology, the transfer operator
 assigns a different open set of the topology: it is a map of sets to sets.
 For iterated maps on the unit interval, it is essentially a map of cylinder
 sets, the open sets of the product topology.
 The shift-XOR experiment shows that the ergodic properties arise from the
 Bernoulli shift, and that all other properties, commonly called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chaotic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, are really the side effect of something else, entirely: the internal structure
 of the transfer operator.
 Fiddling with the carry-bits cannot reveal this structure; instead, they
 just define other, pointlessly goofy iterated functions.
 Point trajectories fail to reveal the internal structure of the transfer
 operator, and at best point in a misleading direction.
 To understand the transfer operator, it must be tackled for what it is:
 one must look at how intervals are mapped to intervals, and what sort of
 symmetries can be discovered in this mapping.
 (I've given one sketch of a proof of the transfer operator as a push-forward
 in this reference:
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Vep-mink2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 There are must surely be better, more accessible and more formal and mathematic
ally refined presentations; if you, reader, know of such, please drop me
 a line.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of the transfer operator on the sets belonging to the topology
 of the reals reveals several distinct kinds of actions.
 The topology on the reals can be generated from a basis consisting of connected
 sets.
 The transfer operator will map some connected sets to other connected sets,
 simply moving them around, shrinking or expanding them.
 In other cases, a connected set will be split into two disjoint parts.
 For maps that are continuous, there must be regions that have fixed-points
 and period-doubling routes to chaos: these correspond to the (countable
 number of) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 illustrated in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Islands-of-Stability"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems reasonable to argue that each of these different kinds of moves
 creates a distinct group (or monoid) of transformations: in a certain sense,
 those transforms that do not change th connectivity, nor do any folding,
 are all similar to one-another.
 It should be possible to write down exactly which sets belong to this type,
 and then give explicit transformation properties between them.
 Likewise, those connected sets which are split in two are all similar.
 It seems like there should be a prototype: a generic split, followed by
 some re-arrangement of the two parts.
 How can this classification be written in an insightful, useful way?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I believe that there has been a sufficient number of advances in the theory
 of subshifts so that the above vague sketch can be presented in a fairly
 concrete way.
 Unfortunately, most of the relevant material remains rather arcane and
 abstract, lacking in direct accessibility to casual students.
 I am not currently aware of any adequate yet accessible treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What, exactly, is the point of analytic mathematics, especially in the computati
onal age? Can't one just get a fast computer, iterate on the logistic map,
 and find out everything there is to find? Well, of course, yes, and no:
 these questions can be taken as either silly or as deeply philosophical,
 and it is worth the effort to understand them and address them properly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, lets dispose of some obvious mis-perceptions.
 If one carefully scrutinizes figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

\end_inset

, one will find signs of a slight unevenness in the horizontal bars.
 These are numerical artifacts due to statistical under-sampling: they smooth
 out and fade away with additional sampling of the iterated equations.
 There is a way to obtain this same figure, far more rapidly, and without
 this particular form of numerical noise: one can instead iterate on equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eigen-eqn"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests one philosophical answer: the goal of mathematics is to find
 faster ways of computing things; to discover better algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A uniting theme between this, and the other text that I have written on
 fractal issues, is that they are all explorations of the structure of the
 Cantor set, the structure of the space of infinite sequences of symbols,
 and the structure of the continuum.
 That is, we know the continuum in two different ways: one way is by means
 of the natural topology on the real number line; the other is the product
 topology on the space of binary strings.
 The former is suggested by the physical universe that we actually live
 in: a continuum with spatial extents.
 The latter is suggested by the notion of time and repetition: the making
 of choices naturally leads to a tree structure; tree structures necessarily
 embed in hyperbolic spaces; the Minkowski space that we live in is hyperbolic,
 and this is why, every day, as time passes on, we get to make new choices
 precisely because the amount of room for possibilities is ever-increasing
 as time flows forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of analytic combinatorics takes on a whole new meaning in the computati
onal age.
 Historically, the ability to provide an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exact solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the form of an analytic series has been highly prized; the ultimate
 acheivement in many cases.
 Being able to expression a solution in terms of the addition and multiplication
 of real numbers is very comforting.
 Every school student eventually comes to feel that arithmetic on the real
 numbers is very natural and normal.
 Its's more than that: Cartesian space is smooth and uniform, and all of
 differential geometry and topology are founded on notions of smoothness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inner workings of computers expose (or hide!) a different truth.
 The most efficient algorithm for computing 
\begin_inset Formula $sine(x)$
\end_inset

 is not to sum the analytic series.
 Arbitrary precision numerical libraries open the rift further: neither
 addition nor multiplication are simple or easy.
 Both operations have a variety of different algorithms that have different
 run-times, different amounts of memory usage.
 In the effort to minimize space and time usage, some of these algorithms
 have grown quite complex.
 The root cause of the complexity is bewildering: it is the use of the binary
 digit expansion to represent a real number.
 Computers use the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 or at least a subset thereof, under the covers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different representations of the real numbers potentially offer different
 algorithms and performance profiles.
 One could represent reals by rationals, but then several other issues arise.
 One is that the rationals are not evenly distributed across the real number
 line: rationals with small denominators cluster about in a fractal fashion.
 This is easily exhibited by considering continued fractions.
 As a result, one promptly gets stuck in a quagmire of trying to understand
 what a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniform distribution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be.
 Binary expansions are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 uniform.
 A more basic issue is that, if working with rationals, one must somehow
 accomplish the addition or multiplication of two integers.
 To accomplish this, one has to represent the integers as sequences of bits,
 which only takes us back to where we started.
 There is no computational oracle that automatically knows the sum or product
 of integers: it has to be computed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compare this situation to that of iterated functions and fractals.
 At first impression, these seem pathological in almost every respect: different
iable nowhere, unbounded and non-uniform: somehow they feel like the quintessent
ial opposite of the analtyic series, of the smoothness of Cartesian space,
 of the smoothness of additon and multiplication.
 The place where these two worlds come together is that both are attempts
 to approach countable infinity, and both are attempts to harness the first
 uncountable infinity.
 The real number number is an infinite string of binary digits.
 The analytic series is an infinite sum.
 The iterated function is recursively infinite.
 The historic labor of finding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exact solutions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to problems can perhaps be better views as the discovery of correspondances
 between finite structures (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the problem to be solved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and infinite structures (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the solution

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation here is more easily illustrated in a different domain.
 The hypergeometric series was presented and studied by Gauss; then Kummer,
 Pfaff and Euler observed various identities yoking together different series.
 By the 1950's, thousands of relations were known, along with some algorithms
 that can enumerate infinite series of relations.
 The current situation is that there is no known algorithm that can enumerate
 all such relations; there is no systematic way to classify them.
 There is an interplay between infinite series and algorithmic relationships
 between them.
 Stated a different way: hypergeometric series have a class of self-similarities
, and the identities relating them are expressions of that self-similarity.
 What is that class of self-similarities? For the hypergeometric series,
 it remains unknown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Cantor space, that place where we represent real numbers, the situation
 is much better.
 The Cantor space itself has the structure of an infinite binary tree; the
 tree and it's subtrees are obviously self-similar; the class of similarities
 is described by the dyadic monoid.
 The dyadic monoid embeds naturally into the modular group; this in turn
 is a gateway to vast tracts of modern mathematics.
 The recursive aspects, the shadow that the Cantor space seems to leave
 behind everywhere appears to be

 by Ornstein theory.

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, the picture remains incomplete.
 The

 together: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra complication
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of taking mod 1 after multiplication just reveals how complex multiplication
 really is.
 After all, mod 1 is just the subtraction of 1; how hard can that be? Moving
 in one direction: the fastest, most efficient-possible algorithm for multiplyin
g two numbers is not known.
 Moving in another direction, the simple iterated maps, shown in figures

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are obviously not only self-similar, but also are surely topologically
 conjugate to one-another, and in all cases are presumably described by
 the dyadic monoid; likewise the Mandelbrot set and it's exterior.
 Yet the details remain obscure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meta-question is: what is the correct framework by which one can best
 understand the interplay between symmetries, infinite series, infinite
 recursion and algorithms? Until modern times, mathematical practice has

 obtain

the right answer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Modern computers have put a lie to this: the theory of numerical methods
 has made clear that addition and multiplication are necessarily algorithmic
 operations performed on finite truncations of infinite series.
 What other aglorithms are hiding nearby, and what is thier relationship
 to analytic series?
