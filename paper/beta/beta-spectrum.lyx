\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transformation is the iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta x\,\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 The special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable.
 The Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)
 behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 The Cantor space consists of infinite strings of binary digits; it is notable
 for many properties, including that it can represent the real number line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The beta transform defines a subshift: iterated on the unit interval, it
 singles out a subspace of the Cantor space that is invariant under the
 action of the left-shift operator.
 That is, lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The spectrum of the Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator of the beta transformation
 is examined.
 Explicit expressions for a set of bounded eigenfunctions is given; they
 compose a discrete spectrum accumulating on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Periodic orbits of the beta transform give eigenvalues that are roots of
 polynomials.
 These form an curious class; they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quasi-cyclotomic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and can be counted with the necklace-counting function.
 They do not have any obvious relation to either Lyndon words or to polynomials
 over the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}$
\end_inset

, despite both of those also being countable by the necklace function.
 The positive real roots include the Golden and silver ratios, the Pisot
 numbers, the n-bonacci (tribonacci, tetranacci, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) numbers and yoke all of these into a regular structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Periodic orbits of the beta transform appear to be in one-to-one correspondence
 with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the Feigenbaum map.
 The beta transformation has no such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but this is apparently because they are degenerate or collapsed down to
 a point.
 The Feigenbaum map opens up at exactly these points, making the islands
 manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This text assumes very little mathematical sophistication on the part of
 the reader, and should be approachable by those with minimal or no prior
 experience in ergodic theory.
 Most of the development is casual.
 As a side effect, the introductory sections are perhaps a fair bit longer
 than strictly needed to present the new results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta transformation is the map 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{\beta}(x)=\beta x\mod1
\]

\end_inset

iterated on the real unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 taken to be a real positive constant.
 For the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, this is the Bernoulli process, the ergodic process of random coin flips.
 This case is solvable in more ways than one; it is very well-explored,
 and is a canonical model of ergodic behavior.
 The beta transformation is less-well studied; a full review of results
 is presented at the end of this introduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two common ways to study iterated functions: in terms of point
 dynamics and orbits (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where does the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 go, when iterated?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and in terms of distributions (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how does a scattered dust of points evolve over iteration?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The approach via distributions is arguably more powerful and constraining,
 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a continuum, a measurable set, rather than a handful of points 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

of measure zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action of an iterated map on a distribution is described in terms of
 the pushforward of the map.
 Informally, in the present case, the pushforward of the beta transform,
 acting on a distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(x\right)=\sum_{y\in t_{\beta}^{-1}\left(x\right)}\frac{\rho\left(y\right)}{\left|t_{\beta}^{\prime}\left(y\right)\right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}^{\prime}=dt_{\beta}/dx$
\end_inset

 so that the denominator is understood as the Jacobian determinant.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is a linear operator, acting on some space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Different spaces result in different properties for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

; commonly explored are the polynomials, and the square-integrable functions,
 and, in certain special cases, the analysis can be extended to highly singular,
 continuous-nowhere functions.
 The pushforward operator is generically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle–Frobenius–Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest eigenvalue is conventionally called the Frobenius–Perron eigenvalue;
 for the beta transform, as for many other iterated maps, it is equal to
 one.
 Solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\mu=\mu$
\end_inset

 define an invariant measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval.
 It is invariant in the usual sense of dynamical systems: one has 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mu\circ t_{\beta}^{-1}\right)\left(x\right)=\mu\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The proper formal statement of this is to invoke the sigma-algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 of Borel sets on the unit interval.
 The inverse of the beta transform is then a map 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}^{-1}:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 while the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a sigma-additive measure.
 The pushforward nature of the transfer operator is now more readily visible:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho=\rho\circ t_{\beta}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 One is generally interested the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L_{\beta}}$
\end_inset

.
 In the current case, the spectrum is simple enough that it can be described
 by eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L_{\beta}\rho=\lambda\rho}$
\end_inset

 of this operator.
 In general, the precise spectrum depends on how the class of mappings 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 might be restricted: 
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 by limiting it to functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that can be interpreted as being polynomials, or square-integrable, 
\emph on
etc.

\emph default
 on the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text will present a complete description of the spectrum in terms of
 finite, bounded functions on the unit interval.
 It is described by the zeros of a certain analytic function.
 For special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the generalized Fibonacci numbers, the analytic function
 becomes a polynomial of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 being binary bits (zero or one).
 These are quasi-cyclotomic, in that their roots are approximately evenly
 distributed in an approximately circular fashion on the complex plane.
 This class of polynomials has numerous interesting properties, but seems
 to never have been studied before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first, the remainder of this introduction: it provides a very basic
 review of some elementary properties of the beta transform, starting with
 the full shift, aka the Bernoulli shift.
 The section is completed with a survey of other research results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bernoulli shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift (
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 the bit-shift map, the dyadic transform or the full shift) is an iterated
 map on the unit interval, given by iteration of the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b(x)=\begin{cases}
2x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
2x-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:Bernoulli shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbolic dynamics of this map gives the binary digit expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 That is, write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b^{n}(x)=(b\circ b\circ\cdots\circ b)(x)=b(b(\cdots b(x)\cdots))
\]

\end_inset

to denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold iteration of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{0}(x)=x$
\end_inset

.
 The symbolic dynamics is given by the bit-sequence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le b^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le b^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:bernoulli-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(Attention: 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is a subscript on the left, and a superscript on the right! The left is
 a sequence, the right is an iteration.
 Using the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 one both sides is a convenient abuse of notation.) Of course, the symbolic
 dynamics recreates the initial real number:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}\left(x\right)2^{-n-1}\label{eq:homomorphism}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

All of this is just a fancy way of saying that a real number can be written
 in terms of it's base-2 binary expansion.
 That is, the binary digits for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=b_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=0.b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bernoulli shift has many interesting properties, connecting it to the
 Cantor set and a large class of self-similar fractals.
 It is also connected to the modular group and elliptic functions (thence
 to number theory and Riemann surfaces).
 It is also the primary example of an ergodic system, and, in a sense, has
 far-reaching implications for ergodic systems via Ornstein theory.
 These various connections are far too numerous to review here, beyond these
 brief mentions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current task is to attempt to see how many of these properties still
 hold in the more general case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shift space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shift space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is formally defined to be a set of infinite sequences of a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 letters (or symbols), together with a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 that takes each sequence, and lops off the left-most symbol.
 For the Bernoulli shift, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 letters, taken from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For the Bernoulli shift, one is typically interested in the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 possible infinite sequences: this is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 One writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 for this shift space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 denoting countable infinity.
 For the Bernoulli shift, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is the shift operator: it just lops of the left-most symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a shift space does not have to include every possible sequence
 of symbols; it does, however, by definition, have to be shift-invariant.
 That is, given some set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of infinite sequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a shift space if and only if, by loping off the leading symbol of each
 string, one regains 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 That is, a shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 must obey 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
TS=S
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\left\{ 000\cdots,111\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 contains only two elements: the string of all zeros, and the string of
 all ones; loping off the leading digit just returns 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 again.
 In general, shift spaces may contain a finite, or a countable, or an uncountabl
e number of elements.
 In general, one defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full shift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the space 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 of all possible strings of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 symbols.
 Subsets that are shift spaces are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subshifts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also deserve some mention: given one specific sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in S$
\end_inset

 out of the shift space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, one can ponder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

where it goes to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as one lops off a symbol at a time.
 This gives the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

symbolic dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orbit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ T^{m}x\,|\,\mbox{integer }m\ge0\right\} $
\end_inset

 – that is, the set of all places that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 goes to.
 There are several possibilities: one is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a fixed point, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Tx=x$
\end_inset

.
 Another is that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a repeating sequence of symbols, in which case iteration repeats as
 well: 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}x=x$
\end_inset

 holds whenever the repeat length is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

; this is a periodic orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, when there are non-periodic orbits, then there are uncountably
 many of them.
 That is, the number of periodic orbits is always countable: there are at
 most 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 starting points for an orbit, and they are of at most length 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This includes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eventually periodic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 orbits: those that begin with some finite initial sequence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 moves, eventually settling into a periodic recurrence.
 This cannot be done for the non-periodic orbits: they cannot be placed
 in lexicographic order; as the Cantor slash argument applies.
 The non-periodic orbits are always uncountable.
 In this sense, the non-periodic orbits are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more important
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that the make up the bulk of all orbits.
 There are situations in which the periodic orbits can be said to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

govern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the dynamics of the aperiodic ones; this is termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coherent structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However such concepts are advanced, and are not obviously applicable to
 the current situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, the goal of this text is to describe what happens to
 the uncountable number of non-periodic orbits.
 The technique to do this is not to describe them individually, but instead
 as collections, distributions, on the unit interval.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta shift is similar to the Bernoulli shift, replacing the number 2
 by a constant real-number value 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

.
 It can be defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:downshift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This map, together with similar maps, is illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Iterated-piece-wise-linear"

\end_inset

 below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the Bernoulli shift generates a sequence of digits, so does the
 beta shift: write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{n}=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{ if }0\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)<\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{ if }\frac{1}{2}\le T_{\beta}^{n}(x)\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:down-bits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given the symbolic dynamics, one can reconstruct the original value whenever
 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\frac{k_{0}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Written this way, the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 clearly acts as a shift on this sequence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\frac{k_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{3}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\frac{k_{4}}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta}\left(\cdots\right)\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

In this sense, this shift is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exactly solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the above provides a closed-form solution for iterating and un-iterating
 the sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying out the above sequence, one obtains the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a real number 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, namely the series
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{n}}{\beta^{n}}\label{eq:shift series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the bit-sequence that was extracted by iteration can be used to
 reconstruct the original real number.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

 in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:down-bits"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 gives the Bernoulli shift: 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}\left(x\right)=b\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the Bernoulli shift, not every possible bit-sequence occurs in this
 system.
 It is a subshift of the full shift: it is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 This is explored in greater detail in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Associated polynomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iterated shift can also be written as a finite sum.
 This is noted here; it will be useful in later sections.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}(x)=\beta\left(x-\frac{k_{0}}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{2}(x)=\beta^{2}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta k_{0}+k_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{3}(x)=\beta^{3}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\left(\beta^{2}k_{0}+\beta k_{1}+k_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The general form is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{p}(x)=\beta^{p}x-\frac{\beta}{2}\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}k_{m}\beta^{p-m-1}\label{eq:iterated shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{m}$
\end_inset

 depend on both 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and are piece-wise discontinuous functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, this is not a true polynomial; however, this polynomial-like representation
 will be useful, later.

 Scare quotes are used, as these are imprecise terms; greater precision
 will be provided shortly.
 The idea of a bifurcation diagram was made famous by the Feigenbaum map
 (shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

), and so the same idea is applied here: track orbits over long periods
 of time, and see where they go.
 This forms a density, which can be numerically explored by histogramming.
 This is shown in figure

\begin_layout Standard
When this is done for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift, one thing becomes immediately apparent: there are no actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bifurcations
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, no period-doubling regions, none of the stuff normally associated with
 the Feigenbaum map.
 Although there are periodic orbits, these form a set of measure zero: the
 iteration produces purely chaotic motion for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this sense, the beta transform provides a clean form of

Formal mathematics distinguishes between many different kinds of chaotic
 number sequences: those that are ergodic, those that are weakly or strongly
 Bernoulli, weakly or strongly mixing.
 The beta transform is known to be ergodic,

 without the pesky

\end_inset

 popping up intermittently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The visualization of the long-term dynamics is done by generating a histogram,
 and then taking the limit, as follows.
 One divides the unit interval into a fixed sequence of equal-sized bins;
 say a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bins, so that each is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N$
\end_inset

 in width.
 Pick a starting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and then iterate: if, at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th iteration, one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $j/N\le b_{\beta}^{n}(x)<(j+1)/N$
\end_inset

, then increment the count for the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 After a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 iterations, let 
\begin_inset Formula $c(j;M)$
\end_inset

 be the count in the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

'th bin.
 This count is the histogram.
 In the limit of a large number of iterations, as well as small bin sizes,
 one obtains a distribution: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y;x)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\lim_{M\to\infty}\frac{c(j;M)}{M}\mbox{ for }\frac{j}{N}\le y<\frac{j+1}{N}
\]

\end_inset

This distribution depends on the initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 chosen for the point to be iterated; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 distribution results when one averages over all starting points:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(y)=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(y;x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset

Numerically, this integration can be achieved by randomly sampling a large
 number of starting points.
 Observe that, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 is a probability distribution:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\int_{0}^{1}\rho(x)\,dx
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probability distributions are the same thing as measures; they assign a
 density to each point on the unit interval.
 It can be shown that this particular distribution is invariant under iteration,
 and thus is often called the invariant measure, or sometimes the Haar measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, one obtains a distinct distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\beta}(y)$

\begin_layout Subsection
Logistic Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logistic map is related to the tent map, and is given by iteration of
 the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}\left(x\right)=2\beta x(1-x)
\]

\end_inset

It essentially replaces the triangle forming the tent map with a parabola
 of the same height.
 That is, the function is defined here so that the the same value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the same height for all three maps.
 Although the heights of the iterators have been aligned so that they match,
 each exhibits rather dramatically different dynamics.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform has a single fixed point for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

, and then explodes into a fully chaotic regime above that.
 By contrast, the logistic map maintains a single fixed point up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3/2$
\end_inset

, where it famously starts a series of period-doubling bifurcations.
 The onset of chaos is where the bifurcations come to a limit, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3.56995/2=1.784975$
\end_inset

.
 Within this chaotic region are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which do not appear in either the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform, or in the tent map.
 The tent map does show a period-doubling regime, but in this region, there
 are no fixed points: rather, the motion is chaotic, but confined to multiple
 arms.
 At any rate, the period doubling occurs at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 than for the logistic map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bifurcation diagram is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Logistic-Map-Bifurcation"

\end_inset

.
 Again, it is worth closely examining the similarities between this, and
 the corresponding tent-map diagram, as well as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform diagram.
 Naively, it would seem that the general structure of the chaotic regions
 are shared by all three maps.
 Thus, in order to understand chaos in the logistic map, it is perhaps easier
 to study it in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 should be apparent, and one can pick out and find visually similar regions
 among these three illustrations.
 Formalizing this similarity is a bit harder, but it can be done: there
 is a way to make all three of these maps be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topologically conjugate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to one-another.
 This is perhaps surprising, but is based on the observation that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the logistic map are countable, and are in one-to-one correspondence
 with certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the iterated beta transformation.
 These are in turn in one-to-one correspondence with rational numbers.
 With a slight distortion of the beta transformation, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be mapped to the islands of stability, in essentially the same way
 that phase locking regions (Arnold tongues) appear in the circle map.
 This is examined in a later section; it is mentioned here only to whet
 the appetite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Beta Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After exactly one iteration of the beta shift, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

, and never leave.
 Likewise, the range of the iterated beta-shift is 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, an alternative representation of the beta shift, filling the entire
 unit square, can be obtained by dividing both the domain and range by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

 to obtain the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
\beta u-1 & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:beta transform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be written more compactly as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the function is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the beta-transform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, written as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation, presenting a typesetting challenge to search engines when
 used in titles of papers.
 The orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the beta-shift is identical to the orbit of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $u=2x/\beta$
\end_inset

 in the beta-transformation.
 Explicitly comparing to the beta-shift of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta}^{n}\left(x\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}t_{\beta}^{n}\left(\frac{2x}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:xform-shift equivalence}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The beta-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation are essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; this text works almost exclusively with the beta-shift, and is thus idiosyncra
tic, as it flouts the more common convention of working with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The primary reason for doing this is to retain contact with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift being a subshift of the full shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a single iteration of the tent map, a similar situation applies.
 After one iteration, all initial points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2\le x\le1$
\end_inset

 are swept up into the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 After a finite number of iterations, all points 
\begin_inset Formula $0<x\le\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 are swept up, so that the remaining iteration takes place on the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(1-\beta/2\right)<x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 It is worth defining a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sidetent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function, which corresponds to the that part of the tent map in which iteration
 is confined.
 It is nothing more than a rescaling of the tent map, ignoring those parts
 outside of the above domain that wander away.
 The sidetent is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta\left(u-1\right)+2 & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\\
\beta\left(1-u\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{\beta-1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Performing a left-right flip on the side-tent brings it closer in form to
 the beta-transformation.
 The flipped version, replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $u\to1-u$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
2-\beta u & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tent map (and the flipped tent) exhibits fixed points (periodic orbits;
 mode-locking) for the smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 These can be eliminated by shifting part of the tent downwards, so that
 the diagonal is never intersected.
 This suggests the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sidetarp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{\beta}(u)=\begin{cases}
\beta u & \mbox{ for }0\le u<\frac{1}{\beta}\\
\beta\left(1-u\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{\beta}\le u\le1

The beta shift map, shown in the upper left, generates orbits that spend
 all of their time in the shaded area: a box of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{2}\times\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Enlarging this box to the unit square gives the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation.
 The tent map resembles the beta shift, except that one arm is flipped to
 make a tent-shape.
 After a finite number of iterations, orbits move entirely in the shaded
 region; enlarging this region to be the unit square gives the sidetent
 map.
 Flipping it left-right gives the fliptent map.
 Although it is not trivially obvious, the fliptent map and the sidetent
 map have the same orbits, and thus the same bifurcation diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The bottom three maps all have fixed points and periodic orbits, essentially
 because the diagonal intersects the map.
 The top three maps have no periodic orbits, and are purely chaotic, essentially
 because the diagonal does not intersect them.
 Note that the slopes and the geometric proportions of all six maps are
 identical; they are merely rearrangents of the same basic elements.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamical Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brief review of dynamical systems is in order, as it provides a coherent
 language with which to talk about and think about the beta-shift.
 The technical reason for this is that a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 provides a more natural setting for the theory, and that a lot of the confusion
 about what happens on the unit interval is intimately entangled with the
 homomorphism 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shift series"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 as the case may be).
 Disentangling the subshift from the homomorphism provides a clearer insight
 into what phenomena are due to which component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The review of dynamical systems here is more-or-less textbook-standard material;
 it is included here only to provide a firm grounding for later discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be given a topology, the product topology.
 The open sets of this topology are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cylinder sets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the infinite strings in three symbols: a finite number of 0 and
 1 symbols, and an infinite number of * symbols, the latter meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

don't care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Set union is defined location-by-location, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cup*=1\cup*=*$
\end_inset

 and set intersection as 
\begin_inset Formula $0\cap*=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cap*=1$
\end_inset

.
 Set complement exchanges 0 and 1 and leaves * alone: 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{1}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{*}=*$
\end_inset

.
 The topology is then the collection of all cylinder sets.
 Note that the intersection of any finite number of cylinder sets is still
 a cylinder set, as is the union of an infinite number of them.
 The product topology does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 contain any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: strings consisting solely of just 0 and 1 are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 allowed in the topology.
 By definition, topologies only allow finite intersections, and thus don't
 provide any way of constructing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, points can always be added 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but doing so tends to generate a topology (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

box topology
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too fine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; in particular, the common-sense notions of a continuous function are ruined
 by fine topologies.
 The product topology is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coarse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Borel algebra, or sigma-algebra, takes the topology and also allows
 set complement.
 This effectively changes nothing, as the open sets are still the cylinder
 sets, although now they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clopen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as they are both closed and open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote the Borel algebra by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 A shift is now a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{B}\to\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set.
 This is provides strong theoretical advantages over working with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point dynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: confusions about counting points and orbits and defining densities go
 away.
 This is done by recasting discussion in terms of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 from Borel sets to the reals (or the complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 or other fields, when this is interesting).
 An important class of such functions are the measures.
 These are functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 that are positive, and are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the sigma algebra, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cup B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)+\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cap B=\varnothing$
\end_inset

 and (for product-space measures) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(A\cap B\right)=\mu\left(A\right)\mu\left(B\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The measure of the total space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 is by convention unity: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototypical example of a measure is the Bernoulli measure, which assigns
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to any string containing a single 0 and the rest all *'s.
 By complement, a string containing a single 1 and the rest all *'s has
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p$
\end_inset

.
 The rest follows from the sigma algebra: a cylinder set consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 zeros and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 ones has measure 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{m}\left(1-p\right)^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually convenient to take 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fair coin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the Bernoulli process is a sequence of coin tosses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is a homomorphism from the Cantor space to the unit interval.
 It extends naturally to a map from the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 to the algebra of intervals on the unit interval.
 It is not an isomorphism: cylinder sets are both open and closed, whereas
 intervals on the real number line are either open, or closed (or half-open).
 It is convenient to take the map as a map to closed intervals, so that
 it's a surjection onto the reals, although usually, this detail does not
 matter.
 What does matter is if one takes 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1/2$
\end_inset

, then the Bernoulli measure is preserved: it is mapped onto the conventional
 measure on the real-number line.
 Thus, the cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $0***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/2\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1***\cdots$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1/2,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and both have a measure of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 and this extends likewise to all intersections and unions.
 Points have a measure of zero.
 That is, the homomorphism 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 preserves the fair-coin Bernoulli measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the map of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is not an isomorphism, it is more-or-less safe for most practical purposes
 to treat it as such.
 For any closed interval, there is a unique corresponding cylinder set.
 The only trouble arises at a countable number of points: all dyadic rationals
 have two expansions, not one, and so there, the map is not invertable.
 However, the points all have a measure of zero in both cases, and there
 are only a countable number of such points, and the mapping always takes
 points to points.
 Thus, the inverse exists for almost all members of the algebra and is unique
 whenever an interval has positive measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of what is said above still holds for subshifts.
 Recall, a subshift 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $TS=S$
\end_inset

.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 inherits a topology from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

; this is the subspace topology.
 The Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 is similarly defined, as are measures.
 One can now (finally!) give a precise definition for an invariant measure:
 it is a measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\circ T^{-1}=\mu$
\end_inset

, or more precisely, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(T^{-1}\left(\sigma\right)\right)=\mu\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 for almost all cylinder sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\in S$
\end_inset

.
 This is what shift invariance looks like.
 Note carefully that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is used in the definition.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a surjection while 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is not: every cylinder set 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in the subshift 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

came from somewhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; we want to define invariance for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and not just for some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is technically called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pushforward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it defines a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 It is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is obviously linear, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(af+bg\right)=a\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(f\right)+b\mathcal{L}_{T}\left(g\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This pushforward is canonically called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfer operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Like any linear operator, it has a spectrum.
 The precise spectrum depends on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical example is again the Bernoulli shift.
 For this, we invoke the inverse of the mapping of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a function defined on the unit interval, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{B}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is the space of real-analytic functions on the unit interval, that is,
 the closure of the space of all polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, then the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is discrete.
 It consists of the Bernoulli polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to an eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 That is,
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}B_{n}=2^{-n}B_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{0}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 is the invariant measure on the full shift.
 For the space of square-integrable functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\left[0,1\right]\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and consists of the unit disk in the complex plane; the
 corresponding eigenfunctions are fractal.
 Even more interesting constructions are possible; the Minkowski question
 mark function provides an example of a measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 that is invariant under the shift defined by the Gauss map 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)\mapsto\frac{1}{x}-\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

.
 That is, as a measure, it solves 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}?^{\prime}=?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $?$
\end_inset

 the Minkowski question mark function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $?^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 it's derivative; note that the derivative is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This rather confusing idea (of something being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous nowhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) can be completely dispelled by observing that it is well-defined on all
 cylinder sets in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 and is finite on all of them – not only finite, but less than one, as any
 good measure must obey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These last examples are mentioned so as to reinforce the idea that working
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 instead of the unit interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$

 really does offer some strong conceptual advantages.
 They also reinforce the idea that the Bernoulli shift is not the only

Similar to the way in which a dyadic rational

Transfer operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discovery and study of invariant measures, as well as of decaying states
 can be approached via the transfer operator, or, properly named, the Ruelle-Fro
benius-Perron operator.
 This is an operator that captures the behavior of a distribution under
 the action of a map.
 The invariant measure is an eigenstate of this operator; indeed, it provides
 a formal definition for what it means to be invariant under the action
 of the map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an iterated map 
\begin_inset Formula $g:[0,1]\to[0,1]$
\end_inset

 on the unit interval, the transfer operator defines how distributions are
 acted on by this map.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=\sum_{x=g^{-1}(y)}\frac{f(x)}{\left|g^{\prime}(x)\right|}
\]

\end_inset

The left adjoint of the transfer operator is the composition operator (Koopman
 operator).
 This is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{C}_{g}f\right]\left(y\right)=f\left(g\left(y\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

The Koopman operator is adjoint, in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{g}\mathcal{C}_{g}=1$
\end_inset

 but that, in general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{g}\mathcal{L}_{g}\ne1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transfer operator for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform are only superficially different.
 We'll give both of them here, as it is sometimes useful to reference one
 or the other, depending on the situation.
 Superficially, they seem to have a different form, but are in the end just
 scaled versions of one-another.
 The transfer operator the beta-shift map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right] & \mbox{ for }0\le y\le\beta/2\\
0 & \mbox{ for }\beta/2<y\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

or, written more compactly
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)\label{eq:xfer oper}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is the Heaviside step function.
 The transfer operator for the beta-transform map 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\beta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]

The density distributions graphed in figure

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\rho\left(y\right)\label{eq:FP-eigenvector}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[\rho\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\rho\left(\frac{y}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)\label{eq:eigen-eqn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Likewise, the Gelfond-Parry measure of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}_{\beta}\nu_{\beta}\right]\left(y\right)=\nu_{\beta}\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{2}{\beta}\nu_{\beta}\left(\frac{2y}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-y\right)$
\end_inset

; the two invariant measures are just scaled copies of one-another.
 Both are normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{1}\rho\left(y\right)dy=\int_{0}^{1}\nu_{\beta}\left(y\right)dy=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these invariant measures are the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron (RFP) eigenfunc
tions of the corresponding operators, as they correspond to the largest
 eigenvalues of the transfer operators, in each case being the eigenvalue
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generally, one is interested in characterizing the spectrum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}\rho\right]\left(y\right)=\lambda\rho\left(y\right)
\]

\end_inset

for eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|\le1$
\end_inset

 and eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(y)$
\end_inset

.
 Solving this equation requires choosing a space of functions in which to
 work.
 Natural choices include any of the Banach spaces, and in particular, the
 space of square-integrable functions.
 Particularly interesting is the space of almost-smooth functions, those
 having discontinuities at only a countable number of locations, but otherwise
 being infinitely differentiable.
 Although the discussion so far implicitly conditions one to restrict oneself
 to real-valued functions, and to consider only real-valued eigenvalues,
 this is perhaps too sharp a restriction.
 It will become clear in the following chapters that even the most basic
 form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has a complex-valued spectrum.
 At any rate, it should be obvious that, whatever the choice of function
 space, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(y\right)=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<2y$
\end_inset

.
 This turns out to be a rather harsh condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least one basic fact is known: for at least some kinds of function spaces,
 the RFP eigenfunction is given by Gel'fond and Parry, as shown in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

.
 More precisely, it is just the rescaled form 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x\right)=\nu\left(2x/\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 and zero otherwise.
 Changing vocabulary, this is sometimes called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant measure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; as it describes a measure on the unit interval.
 That is, for the space of all possible measures on the unit interval, the
 Gel'fond-Parry measure is one of the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator.
 Some caution is advised here: for the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, that is, the Bernoulli shift, one has as an eigenfunction the Minkowski
 measure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vep-mink2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

; it has eigenvalue 1, but is otherwise quite pathological: it is continuous
 nowhere, zero on the rationals, and divergent on the rest (i.e.
 on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Cantor set).
 There's no particular reason to think that this holds only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

; measures can be, in general, very unusual functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very minor simplification can be achieved with a change of variable.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Then the eigenequation becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda\beta\rho\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-\epsilon\right)=\rho\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)+\rho\left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{\beta}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The second term vanishes whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<1-\epsilon/\beta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon<\beta(1-\beta/2)$
\end_inset

 and so one has the simpler recurrence relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda\rho\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\rho\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)\label{eq:eigen-branch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(\beta-1)<2y\le\beta$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eigen-branch"

\end_inset

 can be treated as recurrence relations, defining the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

 eigenstate.
 Recursing on these gives exactly the densities shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Undershift-Density-Distribution"

\end_inset

.
 Computationally, these are much, much cheaper to compute, at least for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 much larger than 1, although convergence issues present themselves as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 approaches 1.
 The resulting density may be called the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron eigenstate;
 because it can be quickly computed, it provides an alternative view of
 figure

 Unfortunately, I find the Russian original of Gelfond's article unreadable,
 and Parry's work, stemming from his PhD thesis, is not available online.
 Therefore, it is of some interest to provide a proof suitable for the current
 text.
 A generalization of this proof is used to construct general eigenfunctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest route seems to be direct verification that eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 is correct, as opposed to a derivation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"

\end_inset

 from first principles.
 This is done below, explicitly showing all steps in laborious detail.
 It's not at all difficult; just a bit hard on the eyes.
 As before, let 
\begin_inset Formula $t\left(x\right)\equiv t_{\beta}\left(x\right)=\beta x\mod1$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transformation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta transform"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 the iterated transformation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(x)$
\end_inset

 be the Heaviside step function as always, and to keep notation brief, let
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\equiv t^{n}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The Gelfond-Parry measure is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(y\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)}{\beta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

where it is more convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{n}\left(y\right)=\Theta\left(t_{n}-y\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transfer operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 for the beta-transformation is slightly more convenient to work with than
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 for this particular case.
 It is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\mathcal{M}f\right]\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\beta}\left[f\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+f\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

and we wish to verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Plugging in directly,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P=\nu\left(\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\nu\left(\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y}{\beta}\right)+\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{y+1}{\beta}\right)\Theta\left(\beta-1-y\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta\left(ax\right)=\Theta\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for all constants 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}\le1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 These terms simplify, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 is small or large.
 Explicitly, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)=0 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)=1 & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1-y\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

These can be collapsed by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\beta t_{n}=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1<0\\
\beta t_{n}-1=t_{n+1} & \mbox{ if }\beta t_{n}-1>0
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\left(1+\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)\left[\Theta\left(1-\beta t_{n}\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right]+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\beta^{n}}\left(\Theta\left(t_{n+1}-y\right)+\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)\right)\\
 & =\beta\nu\left(y\right)-\beta+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t_{n}-1\right)}{\beta^{n}}\\
 & =\beta\nu\left(y\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last sum on the right is just the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion for 1.
 That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\Theta\left(\beta t^{n}\left(x\right)-1\right)}{\beta^{n+1}}
\]

\end_inset

This is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 written in a different way (making use of the equivalence 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xform-shift equivalence"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\beta\nu\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\nu=\nu$
\end_inset

 as claimed.

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\left(y\right)=0$

Staring at the right-hand side of the sum above, it is hardly obvious that
 it should be independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 In a certain sense, this is not

, this holds for a continuum of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 It is an analytic equation tying together the entire subshift.
 For each distinct 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, it singles out three completely different bit-sequences out of the subshift,
 and ties them together.
 It is a form of mixing.
 Alternately, a form of interaction: the bit-sequences are not independent
 of one-another; they interact.
 This section attempts to make these notions more precise.

\begin_layout Standard
The tying-together of seemingly unrelated sequences seems somehow terribly
 important.
 It is tempting to give this some silly name, such as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fundamental theorem of analytic ergodics
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Let's be exceptionally clear about the meaning: equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 defined a map, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 defined a bit-sequence, the

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is the definition of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 The set of all such bit-sequences defines the shift.
 To emphasize the point, its best to compare side-by-side.
 Copying equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 while
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }x<T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)=T^{n+1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

The iterations are running in opposite directions; this is as appropriate,
 since the the transfer operator was a push-forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful here to return to the language of cylinder sets, as opposed
 to point dynamics.
 Recall that the Borel algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 was defined as the sigma algebra, the collection of all cylinder sets in
 the product topology of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 A subshift is a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}\subset\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 together with a map 
\begin_inset Formula $T:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 that lops off the leading symbol of a given cylinder set but otherwise
 preserves the subshift: 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

.
 The inverted map 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a pushforward, in that it defines the transfer operator, a linear operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:\mathcal{F\to\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 on the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 of all functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

; explicitly, it is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{T}:f\mapsto f\circ T^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Insofar as the 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 arose in the exploration of the transfer operator, it is not surprising
 that the shift is acting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backwards
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with point dynamics is that one cannot meaningfully write 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for a real number, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, at least, not without sever contortions that lead back to the Borel algebra.
 Not for lack of trying; the 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Julia set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (to order 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can the analytic relation be restated in terms of cylinder sets? Yes, and
 it follows in a fairly natural way.
 The first step is to extend 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

 to a map 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}:\mathcal{S}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:\mathcal{B}\to\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 be the Bernoulli measure.
 Using the Bernoulli mapping 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:homomorphism"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,T^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 maps to some cylinder; call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, given some cylinder 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

, define
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{n}\left(A\right)=\mu\left(A\cap\Delta_{n}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The rotated (pre-)measure is extended likewise: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu\left(A\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(A\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=z/\beta$
\end_inset

 as before, recovering the Parry measure by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

.
 The Parry measure should be invariant under the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}:\mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

, and otherwise yield eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's check.
 The proof will mirror the one of the previous section.
 Here, it is convenient to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 instead of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 This is primarily a conceptual convenience; the subshift is more easily
 visualized in terms of the mod 1 map.
 Otherwise, the same notation is used, but rescaled, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the cylinder corresponding to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,t^{n}\left(1\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that for every 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 and every 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in A$
\end_inset

, one will find that 
\begin_inset Formula $y/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 and, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $y\le\beta-1$
\end_inset

 that also 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(y+1\right)/\beta\in t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 naturally splits into two parts: the cylinder that maps to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1/\beta\right]$
\end_inset

, call it 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 and the complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pushfoward action is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
= & \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\left[\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Two distinct cases emerge.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)<1/\beta$
\end_inset

 then one has that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}=\varnothing$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the second term can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap\overline{D}\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the second line follows from the first by linearity, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{D}$
\end_inset

 selected out one of the two branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Meanwhile, when 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}\left(1\right)>1/\beta$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $D\subset\Delta_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cap\Delta_{n}=D$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the first term splits into two: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\mu\left(D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)\\
 & =\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(A\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

while
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\mu\left(\Delta_{n}\cap D\cap t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right)=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-t_{n}\right)\frac{1}{\beta}\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)
\]

\end_inset

Reassembling these pieces and making use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{0}\cap A=A$
\end_inset

 one gets
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\nu\left(t^{-1}\left(A\right)\right) & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\left[\mu\left(A\right)\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)+\mu\left(\Delta_{n+1}\cap A\right)\right]\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)-\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}+\mu\left(A\right)\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^{n}}{\beta}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{z}\nu\left(A\right)+\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{z}E\left(\beta;z\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with the constant term as before, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E\left(\beta;z\right) & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}\Theta\left(t_{n}-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\\
 & =-1+\zeta\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\zeta^{n}d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

As before, one has for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;1\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\circ t^{-1}=\nu$
\end_inset

 is indeed the measure invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Other eigenvalues can be found for those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The task at hand is then to characterize 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
The function is easily explored numerically.
 It is clearly convergent in the unit disk 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and has no poles in the disk.
 For almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, there seem to be a countable number of zeros within the disk, accumulating
 uniformly on the boundary as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|\to1$
\end_inset

.
 The notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniformly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be made slightly more precise in the next section, where it is observed
 that, for certain special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 is periodic, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;z\right)$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial.
 When it is polynomial, there are a finite number of zeros (obviously; the
 degree of the polynomial), which are distributed approximately uniformly
 near the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|=1$
\end_inset

.
 As the degree of the polynomial increases, so do the number of zeros; but
 they remain distributed approximately evenly.
 In this sense, the limit of infinite degree seems to continue to hold.

As the zeros accumulate onto the circle

 outside of the unit circle.
 This indicates that there is a lower bound on the possible eigenvalues
 that can be reached via the eigenfunctions of eqn

 It is possible that these exist: certainly, that is the suggestion from

\begin_layout Standard
The iteration of the midpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

, that is, the iterated series 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{n}=T_{\beta}^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

 is ergodic in the unit interval, for almost all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 However, for certain values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the midpoint iterates will hit the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-shift map has a discontinuity.
 Here, iteration stops: at the next step, this point is defined to iterate
 to zero, in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

.
 Zero is a fixed point, and so there is nowhere further to go.
 This section explores these special values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from the definition in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

, one can consider the modified map, where the less-than sign has been altered
 to a less-than-or-equals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{\le}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x\le\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x\le1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this map, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$
\end_inset

 iterates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2$
\end_inset

, which is just the initial midpoint itself.
 In this case, the halted orbits become periodic orbits.
 There is a third possibility, to simply remove the points 0, 1 and 1/2
 from the domain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{\beta}^{<}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0<x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}<x<1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

In this case, if the midpoint iterates to 1/2, it can be taken to simply
 have wandered out of the domain of validity.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wander
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used here in the technical sense: The map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is dissipative in two different senses: first, in the obvious sense, the
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/2<x$
\end_inset

 wander away after exactly one iteration; secondly, the mid-point iterates
 wander down to zero, never to return, unless they are made explicitly periodic
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{\le}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All three variants can be considered together, so that the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 of the three variants, in the strict topological sense of a quotient space.
 Thus, interestingly, for the beta shift, the periodic orbits and the fixed
 point both belong to the same equivalence class.
 This has some interesting implications when one compares the beta shift
 to other iterated maps, such as the logistic map, which have non-trivial
 stable regions.
 Topologically, it would seem that one can perform a kind of surgery, attaching
 stable regions exactly into those spots where, in the beta shift, one has
 an equivalence class.
 This solves (at least for me) the long-standing problem of exactly how
 to properly describe the topological conjugacy between different kinds
 of iterated maps.

 At this location, further iteration breaks down.

This appears to be Sloane's OEIS A001037 which has a number of known relationshi

 The trouble spots are the positive real roots of polynomials of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{\left\{ b_{k}\right\} }\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{n}-\beta^{n-1}-b_{1}\beta^{n-2}-b_{2}\beta^{n-3}-\cdots-1=0

\end_inset

with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 being certain binary bit sequences.
 There is just one such (positive, real) root for each such polynomial.
 These polynomials are relatively prime, in the sense that a bit-sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is disallowed if it has the same root as some lower-order polynomial.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is disallowed; it has the same root as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{2}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 Equivalently, the quadratic is a factor of the quartic; the quartic is
 not relatively prime with respect to the quadratic.

Although the digits

 The analogous trouble-spots again appear, and they can appear after an
 arbitrary finite-length orbit.
 Insofar as they correspond to periodic orbits, they are necessarily counted

 That is, one must consider all possible strings of

 The number of such necklaces is given by the necklace-counting function.

\begin_layout Standard
The above is a rather awkward way of stating that roots must be bracketed
 by pairs of previous roots.
 It can perhaps be more easily understood by studying the location of the
 discontinuities in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Location-of-Midpoints"

\end_inset

: new discontinuities at higher orders must occur before earlier ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for example, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded from the list simply because it is not an iterate of an earlier
 polynomial, even though it has the interesting real root 
\begin_inset Formula $1.324717957244746\cdots$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

silver constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The numbering scheme does not even have a way of numbering this particular
 polynomial.
 Despite this, the silver constant does appear, but a bit later, as the
 root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{8}=\beta^{5}-\beta^{4}-1$
\end_inset

, which is an allowed polynomial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}=\beta^{4}-\beta^{3}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded because it has 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

 as a root, which was previously observed by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}=\beta^{5}-\beta^{4}-\beta-1$
\end_inset

 is excluded because it's root, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{9}=1.497094048762796\cdots$
\end_inset

 is greater than its predecessor 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

; the recursive algorithm does not compare to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{9}$
\end_inset

 is relatively prime to the earlier polynomials, so irreducibility is not
 a sufficient criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other ways to start the table, and to index the polynomials.
 The given indexing has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

, taken as binary, encodes the coefficients of the polynomial.
 The order of the polynomial is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\lceil \log_{2}\left(2n+1\right)\right\rceil $
\end_inset

.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 itself encodes the orbit of the midpoint.
 That is, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $n=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{p}$
\end_inset

 for binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{k}\left(\beta/2\right)<1/2$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2<\beta/2$
\end_inset

 always.
 By convention, the last digit is always 1, also.

\begin_layout Standard
Although there are as many of these polynomials as there are Lyndon words,
 there is no obvious way to write a bijection between the two.
 It is almost possible to do so by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 in binary, and then reversing the order of the bits, left-to-right.
 One almost gets the Lyndon words in the correct order, except 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: so, for example, in the table above, one can get the Lyndon order by exchangin
g 10 with 12, and 13 with 14.
 But the table above cannot be re-ordered: the given ordering encodes the
 orbit of the midpoint.
 Apparently, although a given orbit can be cyclically rotated to obtain
 a Lyndon word, the initial segment of the orbit is not a Lyndon word itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the necklace polynomial also describes the number of elements of
 length 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in a Hall set, there is no obvious correspondence.
 That is, if one writes down the Hall set in two generators, one does not
 obtain the binary strings given in the table above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Questions that present themselves include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is there a generating function for the sequence of allowed values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

? What is it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How long is the initial segment of each periodic orbit, before the orbit
 attains it's Lyndon word form? What are the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 where the initial orbits are not in Lyndon form?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Golden Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The location and distribution of the roots can be visualized in several
 ways.
 One direct technique is via the normalization of the Parry-Gelfond measure.
 The function in eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:invariant measure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 or more generally 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:generalized-eigenfunction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be integrated in a straight-forward manner.
 One has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I\left(\beta;z\right)=\int_{0}^{1}\nu_{\beta;z}\left(x\right)dx=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{\beta^{n}}\int_{0}^{1}d_{n}\left(x\right)dx=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{\beta^{n}}T^{n}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The result is a sawtooh, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Normalization-Integral"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Each disonctinuity corresponds to the real root of one of the polynomials.
 The first few are labelled by the integer labels from the previous table.
 The labels follow an obvious doubling sequence.
 Each doubling sequence has a leader.
 The leaders appear to form a sequence 1,3,7,10,13,15,25,29,31,...
 The leaders are easily obtained: they are what's left of the earlier polynomial
-labelling sequence, after knocking out power-of-two sequences.
 This sequence is not currently known to OEIS.
 The leaders above 1 follow a simple pattern: they are awalys at 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

 of the previous dominant spike.
 So, for example, the first leader above 6 is 13.
 The leaders below 1 are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $n\left(2n+1\right)$
\end_inset

, so for example, the leader above 16 is 
\begin_inset Formula $16\times33=528$
\end_inset

.

It seems natural to assume that the real roots have some distribution.
 This seems not to be the case.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Distribution-of-Golden"

\end_inset

 shows the numerically computed (bin-counted) distribution of the zeros
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2^{k}$
\end_inset

 for three different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that, in the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

, almost all 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 have roots that approach 2.
 Although the roots appear to be dense in 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

, essentially all of the weight of that density is at 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 Since the roots are countable, the density clearly becomes very thin.

 for three different cutoffs, and the corresponding eyeballed fit.
 Bin-counting proceeds by dividing the range

 Proceeding methodically to find roots for all

 At the end of the counting process, the bin-counts are normalized by the
 width of the bin, and the total number of roots observed (
\emph on

 by the Moreau counting function).
 For fixed

 Three different

\begin_layout Subsection
Complex Roots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the complex roots? Numerical work clearly indicates that they seem
 to be approximately cyclotomic in some sense or another.
 They seem to be more-or-less uniformly distributed in an approximate circle,
 always.
 The modulus of most of the complex roots appear to be less than one.
 This is violated for the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+2}-\beta^{k+1}-1$
\end_inset

, where some of the roots in the right-hand quadrant have a modulus larger
 than one.
 By contrast, the complex roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}\beta^{j}$
\end_inset

 seem to always have a modulus less than one.
 These two seem to be the extreme cases: in general, the polynomials appear
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

approximately cyclotomic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Its not clear how to make this statement more precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These numerical results can be argued heuristically: just divide the polynomial
 by it's leading order.
 That is, a general polynomial of this form is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{k}b_{j}z^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

with the convention that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, and the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $n=b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{p}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a terminating orbit.
 Dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k+1}$
\end_inset

gives a series 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\frac{1}{z}-\frac{b_{1}}{z^{2}}-\frac{b_{2}}{z^{3}}-\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Clearly, this can have a zero only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|<2$
\end_inset

 as otherwise, the terms get too small too quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

-Golden 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci Sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that the golden ratio occurs as limit of the ratio of adjacent
 Fibonacci numbers:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varphi=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}}{F_{m-1}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}=F_{m-1}+F_{m-2}$
\end_inset

.
 There is a generalization of this, which also has received attention: the
 tribonacci, quadronacci, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 sequences, whose limits are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{n}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{(n)}}{F_{m-1}^{(n)}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{(n)}=F_{m-1}^{(n)}+F_{m-2}^{(n)}+\cdots+F_{m-n}^{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it possible that the real roots of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 are also the roots of such sequences? But of course they are! Given a finite
 string of binary digits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

, write the beta-Fibonacci sequence as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=b_{0}F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}+b_{1}F_{m-2}^{\{b\}}+\cdots b_{k}F_{m-k}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

The name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta-Fibonacci
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is needed because the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized Fibonacci sequence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is already in wide circulation for the special case of all bits being one.
 The ratio of successive terms is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha^{\{b\}}=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

and is given as the (positive) real root of the polynomial
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=\beta^{k+1}-b_{0}\beta^{k}-b_{1}\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k}=0
\]

\end_inset

These polynomials and their roots were already enumerated and tabulated
 in the previous section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci sequences do not appear by accident: these sequences
 have an ordinary generating function (OGF) given by the polynomial! That
 is,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}z^{m}F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\frac{z^{k}}{1-b_{0}z-b_{1}z^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{k+1}}=\frac{1}{zp_{n}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{k}$
\end_inset

 in the numerator serves only to initiate the sequence so that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\{b\}}=\cdots=F_{k-1}^{\{b\}}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{k}^{\{b\}}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These sequences are generic: they indicate how many different ways one can
 partition the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 into elements of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, for example, the entry for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=12$
\end_inset

 in the table below corresponds to OEIS A079971, which describes the number
 of ways an integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into 1, 2 and 5 (or that 
\begin_inset Formula $5m$
\end_inset

 can be partitioned into nickels, dimes and quarters).
 This corresponds to the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =11001$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},2b_{1},3b_{2},\cdots,\left(k+1\right)b_{k}\right\} =\left\{ 1\cdot1,2\cdot1,3\cdot0,4\cdot0,5\cdot1\right\} =\left\{ 1,2,5\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 From such partitions, it appears that one can build partitions of the positive
 integers that are disjoint, and whose union is the positive integers.
 This suggests a question: can these partitions be expressed as Beatty sequences
?

The previous table is partly repeated below, this time annotated with the

\begin_layout Standard
All of these integer sequences and roots participate in a number of curious
 relations having a regular form; this is, of course, the whole point of
 listing them in the OEIS.
 This suggests a question: do the known relationships generalize to the
 beta-shift setting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, there are various known relations for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized golden means
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These are the roots of the series for which all 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, that is, the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta^{k+1}-\beta^{k}-\beta^{k-1}-\cdots-1=0
\]

\end_inset

In the present notation, these would be the roots of the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2^{k}-1$
\end_inset

.
 Such roots can be rapidly computed by a series provided by Hare, Prodinger
 and Shallit
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hare14"
literal "true"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_{k}}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{j}{j\left(k+1\right) \choose j-1}\frac{1}{2^{j\left(k+1\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

This series is obtained by making good use of the Lagrange inversion formula.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th generalized golden mean, i.e.
 the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2^{k}-1}\left(\alpha_{k}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Can the Hare series be extended to provide the roots 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for general 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another set of observations seem to invoke the theory of complex multiplication
 on elliptic curves, and pose additional questions.
 So:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tribonacci root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{3}=\frac{1}{3}\left(1+\sqrt[3]{19+3\sqrt{33}}+\sqrt[3]{19-3\sqrt{33}}\right)\simeq1.839\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The silver number (plastic number) 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{8}=\frac{1}{6}\left(\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}+\sqrt[3]{108-12\sqrt{69}}\right)\simeq1.324\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Narayana's cows number 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{2}=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt[3]{116+12\sqrt{93}}+\frac{2}{3\sqrt[3]{116+12\sqrt{93}}}+\frac{1}{3}\simeq1.645\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The root 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{6}$
\end_inset

 is related to the silver number 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{8}=r_{6}\left(r_{6}-1\right)$
\end_inset

 and is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{6}=\frac{1}{6}\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}+\frac{2}{\left(\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}\right)^{2}}\simeq1.754\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do the other roots have comparable expressions? To obtain them, is it sufficient
 to articulate the theory of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex multiplication
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on elliptic curves? The appearance of only the cube and square roots is
 certainly suggestive of an underlying process of points on elliptic curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences as shifts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences as shift sequences can be emphasized by noting that
 they arise from the iteration of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k+1\right)\times\left(k+1\right)$
\end_inset

 matrix in lower-Hessenberg form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
b_{0} & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{1} & 0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
b_{2} & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots\\
b_{k-1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1\\
b_{k} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:golden matrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

That is, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th element of the sequence is obtained from the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

'th iterate 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 That such iteration results in integer sequences has long been observed
 in the theory of continued fractions.
 It's useful to work an explicit example.
 For the golden ratio, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and the iterates are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{2}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{3}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
3 & 2\\
2 & 1
\end{array}\right],\;B^{4}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
5 & 3\\
3 & 2
\end{array}\right],\;B^{n}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
F_{n} & F_{n-1}\\
F_{n-1} & F_{n-2}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{n}$
\end_inset

 being the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th Fibonacci number, as usual.
 For the general case, after 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge k-1$
\end_inset

 iterations, one gets the symmetric matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B^{m}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & \cdots & F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-k-1}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\\
F_{m-2}^{\left\{ b\right\} } & F_{m-3}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  & \cdots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
F_{m-k+1}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots\\
F_{m-k}^{\left\{ b\right\} } &  &  & \cdots &  & F_{m-2k}^{\left\{ b\right\} }
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

so that the top row consists of the latest sequence values.
 When multiplied by the bits, this just generates the next iterate in the
 sequence.
 The upper-diagonal 1's just serve to shift columns over by one, with each
 iteration: that is why it's a shift!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is, of course, the polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\left[B-xI\right]=\left(-1\right)^{k}p_{n}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

Thus, we can trivially conclude that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are given by the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This matrix is in lower-Hessenberg form; this makes it obvious that it's
 a shift; a finite shift, in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Equivalent labels for orbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, it should be clear that there are several equivalent ways
 of labeling the expressions under consideration.
 These are recapped here.
 Proofs are omitted; they are straight-forward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Orbits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every given 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta<2$
\end_inset

 there is a unique orbit of midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ m_{p}\right\} $
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}=T_{\beta}\left(m_{p-1}\right)=T_{\beta}^{p}\left(m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}=\beta/2$
\end_inset

.
 The orbits are in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The midpoints are the same as the Parry sequence; namely 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta}^{p}\left(\beta/2\right)=\left(\beta/2\right)t_{\beta}^{p}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

, recalling here the notation of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Orbit encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The midpoint generates a unique sequence of bits 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b_{0},b_{1,},\cdots,b_{k},\cdots\right\} $
\end_inset

 given by the left-right moves of the mid-point, as it is iterated.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=\Theta\left(m_{k}-1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is one if the midpoint is greater than half, else 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 Each bit-sequence is in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Monotonicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compressor function 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(\beta\right)=\sum_{k}b_{k}2^{-k}$
\end_inset

 is a monotonically increasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, so that values of 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 are in one-to-one correspondence with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Polynomial numbering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1+\left\lfloor \log_{2}n\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 being the length of the orbit.
 The positive real root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is in one-to-one correspondence with the bit sequence, and with the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The integer is explicitly given by 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1=\sum_{j=0}^{k}2^{j}b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integer sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then there exists a sequence of integers 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{\{b\}}$
\end_inset

, the beta-Fibonacci sequence, that is in one-to-one correspondence with
 the finite bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

, and with the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the orbit is periodic, then the finite bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, as shown in eqn

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize: any one of these: the integer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, the integer sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

, the orbit of midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}=T^{p}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

, the orbit encoding 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

, the shift matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, the value of the compressor function 
\begin_inset Formula $w\left(\beta\right)$
\end_inset

 and, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 itself can each be used as a stand-in for the others.
 Specifying one determines the others; they all uniquely map to one-another.
 They are all equivalent labels.
 Fashionably abusing notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $n\equiv p_{n}\left(x\right)\equiv\left\{ b\right\} \equiv F_{m}^{\left\{ b\right\} }\equiv m_{p}\equiv w\left(\beta\right)\equiv\beta\equiv B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An explicit expression relating the orbit encoding and the orbit can be
 read off directly from eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:iterated shift"

\end_inset

.
 Plugging in, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{p}=T_{\beta}^{p+1}\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}\left[\beta^{p+1}-\sum_{j=0}^{p}b_{j}\beta^{p-j}\right]\label{eq:midpoint poly}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<k$
\end_inset

 the length of the bit sequence, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{k}=T_{\beta}^{k+1}\left(\beta/2\right)=\beta p_{n}\left(\beta\right)/2=0$
\end_inset

 terminating, since

Four of the correspondences given above ask for periodic orbits.
 Three of these can be extended to non-periodic orbits in an unambiguous
 and uncontroversial way.
 The extensions are covered in the next two sections.
 The fourth is the numbering 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of the finite orbits.
 These are countable; there is no way to extend the counting number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to the non-periodic orbits.
 Indeed, there are too many: the non-periodic orbits are uncountable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Infinite-nacci integer sequences 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta-Fibonacci integer sequence can be extended to arbitrary (
\emph on
viz.

\emph default
 infinite) length bit sequences, as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{m}^{\{b\}}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j-1}F_{m-j}^{\{b\}}
\]

\end_inset

starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{0}^{\left\{ b\right\} }=1$
\end_inset

.
 The sum is always finite, but one cannot perform it without first knowing
 at least the first 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bits of the (now infinite) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The integer sequence still has the desirable property it had before: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{F_{m}^{\{b\}}}{F_{m-1}^{\{b\}}}
\]

\end_inset

Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value is the one associated to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 So, as before, the real number 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and the bit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

 label exactly the same orbit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remarkably, one can be sloppy in how one deals with periodic orbits with
 this extension.
 One has two choices that are equivalent: One choice is to truncate, so
 that the bit-sequence ends with all-zeros, effectively rendering it of
 finite length.
 The alternative is to allow it to continue periodically, forever.
 Either form results in the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequence! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1.6$
\end_inset

, which is close to the golden ratio, but not quite.
 It has an infinite non-periodic (non-recurring) bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =101010010100101000000100\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 The generated integer sequence is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b\}}=1,1,1,2,3,5,8,12,20,32,51,82,130,209,335,535,\cdots$
\end_inset

 which undershoots the Fibonacci sequence (12 appears, where we expected
 13, and 20 instead of 21, and so on).
 The ratio of the last two is 
\begin_inset Formula $535/335=1.597\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the previous is 
\begin_inset Formula $335/209=1.603\cdots$
\end_inset

 and the ratio of successive elements eventually converges to 1.6.
 By comparison, the Fibonacci sequence is generated by the bit-string 1010101010...
 of alternating ones and zeros.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci representation of the orbits has the remarkable property that
 one does not need some 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 mechanism to know if some orbit is periodic or not.
 This dual-representation of periodic orbits is reminiscent of a property
 commonly seen in Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 representations of the real number line, where the dyadic rationals (which
 are countable, of course) map to two distinct bit-sequences (one ending
 in all-ones, the other ending in all-zeros).
 A more general setting for this is given in symbolic dynamics, where the
 totally disconnected Bernoulli scheme 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 can be used to represent elements of certain countable sets two different
 ways.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10$
\end_inset

, one famously has that 1.000...=0.999...
 as an example.
 So likewise here, one can toggle between finite and infinite-periodic strings.
 So, given a finite string 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which has, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, create a new finite string that is twice as long: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b^{\prime}\right\} =b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k-1},0,b_{0},b_{1},\cdots,b_{k}$
\end_inset

 which necessarily has exactly the same beta-Fiboanacci sequence.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{m}^{\{b^{\prime}\}}=F_{m}^{\{b\}}$
\end_inset

.
 Once can repeat this process 
\emph on
ad infinitum
\emph default
, obtaining an infinite periodic string.
 The difference between these two is simply the difference between a less-than-s
ign, and a less-than-or-equal sign used in the generation of the orbit,
 as noted at the very beginning of this chapter.
 We have proven: finite orbits are exactly the same as infinite periodic
 orbits, at least when represented by real numbers and by integer sequences.
 Conversely, the difference between using 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 during iteration is immaterial for describing convergents.

-Polynomials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An infinite polynomial is, of course, an analytic function.
 The goal here is to extend the finite framework.
 The definition of the polynomials above requires a finite bit sequence.
 This can be extended to an asymptotic series, by writing first
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}\left(1-b_{0}z^{-1}-b_{1}z^{-2}-\cdots-b_{k}z^{-k-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Set 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1/z$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta^{k+1}p_{n}\left(\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)=1-b_{0}\zeta-b_{1}\zeta^{2}-\cdots-b_{k}\zeta^{k+1}
\]

\end_inset

which extends to the holomorphic function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=1-\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\zeta^{j+1}
\]

\end_inset

This is manifestly holomorphic on the unit disk, as each coefficient is
 either zero or one.
 It has a positive real zero, of course: 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing to eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holomorphic-disk"

\end_inset

, we see that this is exactly the same function, or rather, it's negative.
 Indeed, following the definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}=d_{n}\left(1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(\beta;\zeta\right)=-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

This at last provides a foot in the door for correctly describing the eigenvalue

 As before, though, this only exposes a discrete spectrum in the region

 access it.

\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 of eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to an infinite-dimensional operator is a bit trickier.
 Of course, one could just declare the matrix elements of the operator to
 be this-and-such, but these matrix elements are with respect to what basis?
 Is the operator even bounded? The answer to the second question is obviously
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic equation of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(B-\lambda I\right)=p_{n}\left(\lambda\right)=0$
\end_inset

; the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

 is too large, although the 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1=\left\lfloor \log_{2}n\right\rfloor $
\end_inset

 other roots are conveniently arranged near the unit circle, more-or-less
 equidistant from one another.
 The solution is to rescale 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 The Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue is now one, and the remaining eigenvalues
 distributed near or on a circle of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 We may as well take the transpose as well, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}=B^{T}/\beta$
\end_inset

 is in upper-Hessenberg form.
 Rescaled in this way, it now seems safe to declare, by fiat, that the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the correct extension of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to infinite dimensions.
 Just to be explicit: given the bit-sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

, the operator
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 has the matrix elements
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle  & =\frac{b_{j}}{\beta}\\
\left\langle j+1\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{\beta}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with all other entries being zero.
 This is clearly in upper-Hessenberg form, with the subdiagonal providing
 the shift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The invariant measure is then the Frobenius-Perron eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 solving 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\sigma=\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to write down 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 explicitly: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(1,\beta^{-1},\beta^{-2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}=\beta^{-j}$
\end_inset

.
 This is obviously so: the subdiagonal entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 act as a shift on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and the top row is just
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle \sigma_{j}=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}b_{j}\beta^{-j-1}=1-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\right)=1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is not triangular, (and thus not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solvable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), it does have a dramatically simple form.
 It also re-affirms the Ansatz 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

 for the eigenfunctions.
 To be explicit: if 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is a vector satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

, with vector elements 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

, then the function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(x\right)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}d_{j}\left(x\right)v_{j}
\]

\end_inset

 is an eigenfunction of the transfer operator: that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{L}_{\beta}v\right]\left(x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, or, explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\beta}\left[v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)+v\left(\frac{x}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\Theta\left(\frac{\beta}{2}-x\right)=\lambda v\left(x\right)\label{eq:fundamental-shift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xfer oper"

\end_inset

.
 So, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, this is just 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\sigma$
\end_inset

 which is just eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:coherent-first-order"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, the invariant measure, as always.
 But it also says more: the 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 solutions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}v=\lambda v$
\end_inset

 are necessarily of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\left(1,\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-1},\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{-2},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

, because the subdiagonal forces this shift.
 To satisfy the the top row of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, one must have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left\langle 0\left|\mathcal{H}_{\beta}\right|j\right\rangle v_{j}=\frac{1}{\beta}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{b_{j}}{\left(\lambda\beta\right)^{j}}=\lambda\left(1-q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\frac{1}{\lambda\beta}\right)\right)=\lambda
\]

\end_inset

and so the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is exactly the eigenvalue that solves the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-series 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(1/\lambda\beta\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This effectively concludes a proof: the solutions to this series are the
 only eigenvalues of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transfer operator; there are no others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap: periodic orbits have an associated shift matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

; this extends naturally to a shift operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}_{\beta}$

 for non-periodic orbits.
 The shift operator has a sufficiently simple form that it's eigenvectors
 can be explicitly written down in closed form; they are necessarily coherent
 states
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

coherent states
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from quantum optics: a state that can be written as an analytic series
 over states/vectors expressed in a different basis.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The top row of the shift operator defines a holomorphic function 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

 whose zeros correspond to eigenstates of the shift operator.
 The holomorphic function is determined by the binary digit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ b\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The binary digit sequence is obtained from the iterated midpoint, as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}=d_{j}\left(1/2\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x<T^{n}\left(\beta/2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This is enough to prove eqn 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 holds for the special value 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 (for

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 It was previously proven that the vanishing of

, or, more precisely, the zeros for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right|\le1$

 The reason for this limitation is that the eigenstates are explicitly given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

for

 One might hope to analytically continue this to the entire complex plane,
 but the continuation depends on the digit sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{m}\left(x\right)$

 One might expect that an analytic continuation is impossible, as the

\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1/\zeta=1.28519903324535\cdots$

 The complex zeros are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0.965709509\cdots\exp\pm i\pi0.2740452363\cdots$

 which corresponds to eigenvalues are

\begin_layout Standard
The order of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }$
\end_inset

 is six, and this has six almost-plateaus; they are not quite flat, although
 they are close to it, presumably because 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 is close to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The general case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generalizing from the above, one finds the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a period-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 orbit, the infinite series is 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\cdots\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)=q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)/\left(1-\zeta^{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first label 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

 has a complex zero within the disk is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=16$
\end_inset

.
 As a general rule, it seems that complex zeros inside the disk only appear
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 (I believe; have not carefully checked.
 This seems reasonable, as later chapters show that the region of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<\varphi$
\end_inset

 behaves very differently from larger values.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The invariant measure has 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 plateaus.
 The plateau boundaries are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{m}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\{ 0,\cdots,k-1\right\} $
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\beta}{2}$
\end_inset

, and so on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The left-most plateau (of the invariant measure) is at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta/\left(\beta-1\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}1/\beta^{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other plateaus appear to be at simple rational functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, but a precise expression is elusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the last issue, perhaps one can find tools in Galois theory.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]$
\end_inset

 be the ring of polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 and consider the quotient ring 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\mathbb{R}\left[\zeta\right]/q^{\left\{ b\right\} }\left(\zeta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a field extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and so one expects a Galois group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Gal}\left(L/\mathbb{R}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The plateaus of the invariant measure are presumably associated with the
 group elements.
 This seems like a promising direction to go in: perhaps this is just enough
 to explain the length of an orbit, the sequence of points in the orbit,
 the reason that some polynomials are forbidden (they don't generate prime
 ideals), the appearance of Moreau's necklace-counting function,
\emph on
 etc
\emph default
.
 This remains an unfinished exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Factorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomials factorize.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{n}$
\end_inset

 denote the real positive root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 – that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}\left(r_{n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then one has the factorizations (dropping the subscript on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for readability)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+r-1\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\left(x\right)=x-1$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, there are two order-3 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+rp_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

while
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xp_{0}\left(r\right)+p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

Continuing in this way, there are three order-4 polynomials.
 They factor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-x-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+p_{3}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-x^{2}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xp_{1}\left(r\right)+rp_{1}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and (noting that there is no 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{5}$
\end_inset

 that occurs in the series)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=x^{4}-x^{3}-1=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)+xrp_{0}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{0}\left(r\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's clearly a progression, but perhaps a bit difficult to grasp.
 It can be more clearly seen by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}=q_{2n+1}$
\end_inset

 and then writing out 
\begin_inset Formula $2n+1$
\end_inset

 in binary.
 So, once again, from the top:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}\left(x\right)=q_{11}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x+q_{1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=q_{1}\left(r\right)$
\end_inset

 which adopts the shorthand that the 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 polynomials on the right-hand side always have 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 as an argument, which can be dropped for clarity.
 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\left(r\right)=r$
\end_inset

 was already previously observed, in an earlier section.
 That is, using the dropped-
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 convention, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=r$
\end_inset

.
 Next
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{2}\left(x\right)=q_{101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{01}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{01}\left(x\right)\equiv rq_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Next,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{3}\left(x\right)=q_{111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{2}+xq_{1}+q_{11}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is the second factorization of order 3.
 For order 4, one has
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{4}\left(x\right)=q_{1001}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{01}+q_{001}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, this time, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{001}\left(x\right)=xq_{01}\left(x\right)=x^{2}q_{1}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Continuing,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{6}\left(x\right)=q_{1101}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{011}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, by definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{011}\left(x\right)\equiv xq_{11}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{7}\left(x\right)=q_{1111}\left(x\right)=\left(x-r\right)\left(x^{3}+x^{2}q_{1}+xq_{11}+q_{111}\right)
\]

\end_inset

It is worth doing one more, just to clinch that the reversal of the bit
 sequence is indeed correct.
 For this purpose, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{12}=q_{11001}$
\end_inset

 should serve well.
 One has
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p_{12}\left(x\right)=q_{11001}\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}p_{0}\left(r\right)+x^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)+xrp_{1}\left(r\right)+r^{2}p_{1}\left(r\right)\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}q_{1}+x^{2}q_{11}+xq_{011}+q_{0011}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general pattern should now be clear.
 Given one of the admissible bit sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}$
\end_inset

 and recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 always, (and that 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 always) one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{n}\left(z\right)=q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=z^{k+1}-b_{0}z^{k}-b_{1}z^{k-1}-\cdots-b_{k-1}z-1
\]

\end_inset

which has the factorization, with bits reversed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z^{k}+z^{k-1}q_{b_{0}}+z^{k-2}q_{b_{1}b_{0}}+z^{k-3}q_{b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}}+\cdots+q_{b_{k-1}b_{k-2}\cdots b_{1}b_{0}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where, as already noted, each 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial in the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Although, notationally, the root 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 was taken as the real root, the above factorization works for any root.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick can be repeated.
 Although at first it might seem daunting, the pattern is uniform: every
 power of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 occurred in the above.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s\ne r$
\end_inset

 be some other root.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}\cdots b_{k-1}b_{k}}\left(z\right)=\left(z-r\right)\left(z-s\right)\left(z^{k-1}+\left(s+q_{b_{0}}\right)z^{k-2}+\left(s^{2}+sq_{b_{0}}+q_{b_{o}b_{1}}\right)z^{k-3}+\cdots\right)
\]

\end_inset

The coefficient of the next term being 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{3}+s^{2}q_{b_{0}}+sq_{b_{o}b_{1}}+q_{b_{0}b_{1}b_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 From this point one, this becomes just an ordinary factorization of polynomials...
 well, but so was the first step, as well.
 What made the first step interesting was that, because the coefficients
 at that step were explicitly either zero or one, the corresponding reversal
 of the bit sequence became manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may as well bring this detour to a close.
 There's nothing particularly magic in the above factorization, other than
 the combinatorial re-arrangement of the polynomial labels.
 A generic polynomial factorization looks like the below, for comparison.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(x\right)=x^{n+1}+c_{0}x^{n}+c_{1}x^{n-1}+\cdots c_{n}
\]

\end_inset

and if 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a root of 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
viz
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(r\right)=0$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(x\right)= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+\left(r+c_{0}\right)x^{n-1}+\left(r^{2}+c_{0}r+c_{1}\right)x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)\\
= & \left(x-r\right)\left(x^{n}+a_{0}x^{n-1}+a_{1}x^{n-2}+\cdots\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{k}=r^{k+1}+\sum_{j=0}^{k}c_{j}r^{k-j}
\]

\end_inset

There are some notable values occurring in the factorization.
 These are shown in the table below:

As may be seen, some of these constants are already notable for various
 reasons.
 Many are also the real roots of yet other polynomials, of a not entirely
 obvious form.
 (Well, the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 polynomials will always be obvious expansions in binomial coefficients).
 The suggestion here is that these are all in turn part of some filigreed
 partially-ordered set of intertwining polynomials.
 Exactly how to express that intertwining in any sort of elegant or insightful
 way is not obvious.

 The goal of the label is to provide a unique identifier for each discontinuity

 Recall that each discontinuity corresponds to a periodic orbit, and so
 these labels apply to the periodic orbits.

The patterned regularity in this labeling scheme is hopefully apparent.
 The largest discontinuity is given a label of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It is the leader of a period-doubling sequence, given labels 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[2\right]$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 The largest discontinuity between 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n-1\right]$
\end_inset

 is given the label 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n,0\right]$
\end_inset

 and it leads a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n,1\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[n,2\right]$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 At the right-most end of the graph, at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

, the appropriate label appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[-1\right]$
\end_inset

.
 With this observation, the labeling is completely regular.
 Each interval brackets a sequence of discontinuities, ad infinitum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bracketing relationship can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k-1}\right]\Mapsto\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\Mapsfrom\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{p}-1\right]
\]

\end_inset

with where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the largest integer 
\begin_inset Formula $1<p\le k-1$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}\ne0$
\end_inset

.
 The notation here is that each label is brackets by a pair of shorter labels,
 on the left, and on the right.
 Each label corresponds to a specific 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value; write 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 for this value.
 The bracketing relationship states that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k-1}\right]\right)<\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\right)<\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{p}-1\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

with the inequalities being strict.
 Each interval is of decreasing size, limiting to zero, as the length of
 the integer sequences expand.
 As the bounds are increasingly tight, they bracket a unique convergent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, the non-periodic 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are placed in one-to-one correspondence with infinite length integer sequences.
 That this is one-to-on and onto, a bijection, between all reals in the
 interval 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 and Baire space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{N}_{0}$
\end_inset

 are the non-negative integers, will be clarified shortly below, after a
 treatment of the finite-length sequences.

The above algorithm will generate polynomials in descending 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-order, that is, in an order such that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 of each sequence is less than the previous one.
 It provides a total order, possible only because infinite recursion is
 prevented by the two recursion limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Periodic 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values correspond to finite sequences.
 There is a way to convert these finite sequences into equivalent infinite
 sequences.
 The upper bound of all sequences is 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\left[-1\right]\right)=2$
\end_inset

; it is larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\left[0,0,\cdots,0\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 for any finite run of zeros.
 From this, it is reasonable to make the identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[-1\right]=\left[0,0,\cdots\right]
\]

\end_inset

as a notational convenience.
 Closer examination reveals that each discontinuity visible in the figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Discontinuity-labels"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be labeled this way.
 That is, each finite-length label has a corresponding infinite-length label:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]=\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}+1,-1\right]=\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}+1,0,0,\cdots\right]
\]

\end_inset

It was already apparent that finite-length strings were in one-to-one correspond
ence with periodic 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 orbits.
 This maps them cleanly, one-to-one, to infinite zero-terminated strings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This extension of finite sequences into infinite ones provides the last
 step needed to provide a one-to-one and onto mapping, a bijection, between
 all real values 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 and Baire space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{N}^{\omega}$
\end_inset

, with no duplications or couble-counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bijection can be explicitly exhibited as follows.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 that correspond to a periodic orbit, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value is the one real root of one of the corresponding beta polynomial
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

 for some index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

; equivalently, it is the convergent of one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-Fibonacci sequences, for that same index 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The index is given by a recursive formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n=\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]=2^{m_{k}+m_{1}+m_{2}+\cdots+m_{k-2}}\left(2\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k-1}\right]+1\right)
\]

\end_inset

which is anchored by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m\right]=2^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 These are the integer labels appears on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Normalization-Integral"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The recursion relation can be obtained from the bracketing relationship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recursion relation is a bijection; it works in both directions; the
 index can be obtained from a sequence, and vice-versa.
 In the inverted form, it reveals a more concise explanation for why some
 indexes do not appear.
 Recall from earlier chapters that indexes do not appear when polynomial
 roots aren't correctly bracketed; they aren't correctly bracketed when
 a given polynomial can be factored into one of lower order.
 This recursion relation gives a short description: indexes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are prohibited when the final reverse iterate has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2^{m}+1\right)$
\end_inset

 for some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m>1$
\end_inset

 xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

 can be re-interpreted as continued fractions.
 That is, for each such sequence, there is a real number 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\right)=\dfrac{1}{m_{1}+1+\dfrac{1}{m_{2}+1+\dfrac{1}{\cdots}}}
\]

\end_inset

This provides an injection of Baire space (into) the reals (of the unit
 interval).
 It is not a surjection, as the rationals do not appear.
 Combining these two mappings gives an injection from the intervale 
\begin_inset Formula $1<\beta\le2$
\end_inset

 to the unit interval.
 This is termed the

 It is clearly self-similar.
 Some of the vertical joins are drawn not quite vertical; this is due to

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

odometer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is perhaps a bit cryptic; a quick review is in order.
 An odometer of characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is defined as the set of all infinite-length integer sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 with each 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 drawn from the cyclic group 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
 This set is endowed with a transition function 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 given by the map 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)\mapsto\begin{cases}
\left(a_{0}+1,a_{1},\cdots\right) & \mbox{if }a_{0}\ne p-1\\
\left(0,\cdots,0,a_{k}+1,a_{k+1},\cdots\right) & \mbox{if }\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)=\left(p-1,\cdots,p-1,a_{k},a_{k+1},\cdots\right)
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

That is, it increments 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

 by one, and if that rolls over, then a carry bit is propagated to the next
 term, and so on.
 This is just 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic addition, treated as a dynamical system.
 It can also be interpreted as a map of the unit interval, to itself, when
 the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 is interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{n}a_{n}p^{-n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 As a map of the unit interval, it permutes a countable sequence of intervals
 of decreasing size.
 Odometers are bijections of the unit interval into itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-odometer can be taken to be an odometer of characteristic zero.
 The rationale for this opaque claim can be clarified by looking at how
 it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rolls over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The prototypical roll-over occurs at the juncture of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\varphi=1.618\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 One observes the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[0,1\right] & =\beta=1.75488\cdots\\
\left[0,2\right] & =\beta=1.70490\cdots\\
 & \vdots\\
\left[0,16\right] & =\beta=1.61816\cdots\\
\left[0,N\right] & =\beta>\varphi\mbox{ for }N\to\infty\\
\left[0\right]=\left[1,-1\right]=\left[1,0,0,\cdots\right] & =\beta=\varphi\\
\left[1,0,0,\cdots,1,\cdots\right] & =\beta<\varphi
\end{align*}

\end_inset

That is, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,N\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 rolls over to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[1,0,0,\cdots\right]$
\end_inset

.
 It is this peculiar behavior that merits the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

odometer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Analogously, a rollover happens at every finite string.
 The bracketing relation supplies a descending sequence leading up to the
 rollover:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,N\right]\right)<\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,N-1\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

At the rollover point, the final digit is dropped:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\right)<\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k},N\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

After the rollover, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}+1,0\right]\right)<\beta\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{k}\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic case, there is no way to increment/decrement the odometer by one unit
 so as to maintain the total order on 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Incrementing the first digit gives a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\left(\left[N\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 that approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

, but it has nowhere to rollover to.
 There's no way to get to the last digit of an infinite string, to increment
 that.
 The best one can do is to write out the expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, decrement by some arbitrarily small 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and notice that the expansion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 has rolled over at some location.
 The increment is, formally speaking, an infinitesimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-adic odometers are interval maps; they re-arrange countable sequences of
 subintervals of the unit interval.
 Here, likewise, the beta odometer rearranges intervals, at least in the
 sense that rearrangements are disjoint.
 So, the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\varphi,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)$
\end_inset

 albeit in a fractal manner, and likewise each subinterval bounded by the
 descending series of roots to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{n}-\beta^{n-1}-1=0$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n-1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 By self-symmetry, the sub-intervals will re-arrange as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A precise expression for the self-symmetry is easy to write in symbolic
 form.
 There are two, actually; one is a shift:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g:\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\mapsto\left[m_{1}+1,m_{2},\cdots\right]
\]

\end_inset

and the other is a reflection.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r:\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\mapsto\left[1,m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]
\]

\end_inset

When the sequences are interpreted as continued fractions, they have a ready
 expression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c\left(r\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\right)\right)=c\left(\left[1,m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\right)=1-c\left(\left[m_{1},m_{2},\cdots\right]\right)
\]

\end_inset

that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $r\left(x\right)=1-x$
\end_inset

; thus a reflection.
 The shift acting on the continued fractions is likewise a Möbius transformation
: 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(x\right)=x/\left(x+1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 By contrast, there is no obvious simple expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for the odometer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together, these two generate the dyadic monoid.
 That is, a general expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g^{a}\circ r\circ g^{b}\circ\cdots$
\end_inset

 is still a self-symmetry of the odometer.
 Such elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the infinite
 binary tree, i.e.
 the dyadic monoid.

The trouble-spots, the eventual fixed-points of the map, can be placed in
 one-to-one accordance with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

islands of stability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seen in the iterated logistic map.
 They are, in essence, locations where periodic orbits 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

could be pasted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or where they 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

naturally would appear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, if the map supported periodic attractors.
 That is, the beta shift only supports a single attractor, of period-one
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

; there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

room
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for anything more.
 This is analogous, in a way, to the phase locked loop, at zero coupling
 constant.
 At finite coupling strength, these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trouble spots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expand out as Arnold tongues, to have a finite size, visible on the Feigenbaum
 diagram for the logistic map as regions where period-doubling is occurring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here can be illustrated explicitly.
 Basically, take the natural saw-tooth shape of the map, widen the middle,
 and insert a slanting downward line, to create a zig-zag.
 That is, connect the two endpoints in the middle of the beta shift, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

widening
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it so that it has a finite, not infinite slope, thereby converting the
 iterated function from a discontinuous to a continuous one.
 This can be constructed directly: given some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, real 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon>0$
\end_inset

, define the piecewise-linear 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

-generalization of the map 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:downshift"

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\beta,\varepsilon}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\\
\frac{\beta}{4}-\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)w & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\le x<\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:zig-zag map}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is just a handy notation for a downward sloping line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w=\frac{2x-1}{2\varepsilon}
\]

\end_inset

Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $w=-1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 just smoothly interpolates between +1 and -1 over the middle interval.
 The additional factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\beta}{4}-\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)w$
\end_inset

 just serves to insert the downward slope smack into the middle, so that
 the endpoints join up.
 The results is the zig-zag map, illustrated in the figure below

In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\to0$
\end_inset

, one regains the earlier beta shift: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\varepsilon\to0}T_{\beta,\varepsilon}=T_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, as the slope of the middle bit becomes infinite.
 The middle segment is a straight line; it introduces another folding segment
 into the map.
 This segment introduces a critical point only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently small, so that its slope is less than 45 degrees (is greater
 than -1).
 When this occurs, a fixed point appears at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1/2$

 Moving upwards, one can see a faint island at the tribonacci number.
 Due to the general asymmetry of the map, these islands quickly shift away
 from these limiting values.
 For example, the primary island appears to start near

 the right column.
 The other islands shift away in a more complicated fashion.

Two more variant maps can be considered.
 Both replace the center piece with symmetrical sinuous S-shaped curves,
 but in different ways.
 Consider
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{\beta,\varepsilon,\sigma}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\\
\frac{\beta}{4}-\sigma\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)\sin\frac{\pi}{2}w & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\le x<\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:sine map}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{\beta,\varepsilon,p,\sigma}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\\
\frac{\beta}{4}-\sigma\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)\mbox{sgn}\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left|w\right|^{p} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\le x<\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\le x\le1
\end{cases}\label{eq:hard map}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\beta,\varepsilon}(x)$
\end_inset

 replaces the central segment with a softly-rounded segment, containing
 two critical points: near 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and near 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, where the curve flattens out to a zero slope.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=+1$
\end_inset

, the map as a whole is continuous.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-1$
\end_inset

, the map consists of three discontinuous pieces.

 The upper row is much like the sequence shown in figure

 The middle row shows the same

 The bottom row shows eqn

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=-1$
\end_inset

; thus, because 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 gives a straight-line segment in the middle, this bottom row is directly
 comparable to the zig-zag map.
 It should make clear that the islands appear in the middle row due to critical
 points in the S-curve, and not due to the tripartite map.
 The lower right diagram exhibits islands, but only because the middle segment
 has a slope of less than 45 degrees, resulting in a critical point at the
 middle of the map.
 As usual, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 As usual, the parameter

\end_inset

 runs from 1 at the bottom to 2 at the top.
 In all cases, islands appear, and numerous common features are evident.
 Perhaps most interesting is that the islands do NOT contain period-doubling
 sequences.
 The primary sequence of islands, starting from the central largest, proceeding
 downwards, are located the inverse powers of two, 
\emph on

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\sqrt[k]{2}$

 Why are the islands located at inverse powers of two, instead or, for example,
 the golden means? The short answer: it depends on the location of the kink
 in the map, as explored in the main text.

 The Poincaré recurrence time is obtained by iterating on the maps, and
 then counting how many iterations it takes to get near an earlier point.
 The color coding is such that yellow/red indicates large recurrence times;
 green is intermediate time, blue a short time, and black corresponds to
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 less than 3 or 4 or so.
 The vertical black spikes are the Arnold tongues; they correspond to parameter
 regions which lie in an island of stability.
 That is, the recurrence time is low, precisely because the the point

 is bouncing between a discrete set of values.
 The yellow/red regions correspond to chaos, where the iterate

\[
H_{\beta,\varepsilon,\alpha,\sigma}(x)=\begin{cases}
\beta x & \mbox{ for }0\le x<\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\\
\frac{\beta}{4}-\sigma\beta\left(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon\right)h_{\alpha,p} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\le x<\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\\
\beta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right) & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\le x\le1
\end{cases}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{\alpha,p}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
\alpha+\left(1-\alpha\right)\left|w\right|^{p} & \mbox{ for }x<\frac{1}{2}\\
\alpha-\left(1+\alpha\right)\left|w\right|^{p} & \mbox{ for }\frac{1}{2}\le x
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

As before, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is designed to interpolate appropriately, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon\right)=-1$
\end_inset

.
 The location of the kink is now adjustable: 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\alpha,p}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Iterating on this map results in figures that are generically similar to
 those of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Interpolating-Kink-Map"

\end_inset

, except that this time, the location of the islands is controllable by
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Roughly, to first order, the primary series of islands are located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt[k]{2/\left(1-\alpha\right)}$
\end_inset

; as before, these islands do not allow period-doubling to take place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get islands with period doubling, one needs to re-create the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the above presents a general surgical technique for controlling both
 the general form of the chaotic regions, the location of the islands of
 stability, and what appears within the islands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conjectures are fun! The above arguments should be sufficient to fully demonstra
te that the circle map, which is well-known to exhibit phase locking regions
 called Arnold tongues, is topologically conjugate to the fattened beta
 shift 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\beta,\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
 Or something like that.
 In a certain sense, this can be argued to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solution, via topological conjugacy, of the tent map, the logistic map
 and the circle map.
 This is a worthwhile exercise to actually perform, i.e.
 to give explicit expressions mapping the various regions, as appropriate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, the claim is straight-forward: topologically, all chaotic parts
 of a map correspond to folding (as per Milnor, 1980's on kneading maps),
 into which one may surgically insert regions that have cycles of finite
 length.
 The surgical insertion can occur only at the discontinuities of the kneading
 map.
 It almost sounds trivial, expressed this way; but the algebraic articulation
 of the idea would be worthwhile.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of analytic combinatorics takes on a whole new meaning in the computati
onal age.
 Historically, the ability to provide an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exact solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the form of an analytic series has been highly prized; the ultimate
 achievement in many cases.
 Being able to expression a solution in terms of the addition and multiplication
 of real numbers is very comforting.
 Every school student eventually comes to feel that arithmetic on the real
 numbers is very natural and normal.
 It's more than that: Cartesian space is smooth and uniform, and all of
 differential geometry and topology are founded on notions of smoothness.

\begin_inset Formula $sine(x)$
\end_inset

 is not to sum the analytic series.
 Arbitrary precision numerical libraries open the rift further: neither
 addition nor multiplication are simple or easy.
 Both operations have a variety of different algorithms that have different
 run-times, different amounts of memory usage.
 In the effort to minimize space and time usage, some of these algorithms
 have grown quite complex.
 The root cause of the complexity is bewildering: it is the use of the binary
 digit expansion to represent a real number.
 Computers use the Cantor space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\omega}$
\end_inset

 or at least a subset thereof, under the covers.

Different representations of the real numbers potentially offer different
 algorithms and performance profiles.
 One could represent reals by rationals, but then several other issues arise.
 One is that the rationals are not evenly distributed across the real number
 line: rationals with small denominators cluster about in a fractal fashion.
 This is easily exhibited by considering continued fractions.
 As a result, one promptly gets stuck in a quagmire of trying to understand
 what a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uniform distribution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be.
 Binary expansions are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 uniform.
 A more basic issue is that, if working with rationals, one must somehow
 accomplish the addition or multiplication of two integers.
 To accomplish this, one has to represent the integers as sequences of bits,
 which only takes us back to where we started.
 There is no computational oracle that automatically knows the sum or product
 of integers: it has to be computed.

Compare this situation to that of iterated functions and fractals.
 At first impression, these seem pathological in almost every respect: different
iable nowhere, unbounded and non-uniform: somehow they feel like the quintessent
ial opposite of the analytic series, of the smoothness of Cartesian space,
 of the smoothness of addition and multiplication.
 The place where these two worlds come together is that both are attempts
 to approach countable infinity, and both are attempts to harness the first
 uncountable infinity.
 The real number number is an infinite string of binary digits.
 The analytic series is an infinite sum.
 The iterated function is recursively infinite.
 The historic labor of finding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

exact solutions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to problems can perhaps be better views as the discovery of correspondences
 between finite structures (

The situation here is more easily illustrated in a different domain.
 The hypergeometric series was presented and studied by Gauss; then Kummer,
 Pfaff and Euler observed various identities yoking together different series.
 By the 1950's, thousands of relations were known, along with some algorithms
 that can enumerate infinite series of relations.
 The current situation is that there is no known algorithm that can enumerate
 all such relations; there is no systematic way to classify them.
 There is an interplay between infinite series and algorithmic relationships
 between them.
 Stated a different way: hypergeometric series have a class of self-similarities
, and the identities relating them are expressions of that self-similarity.
 What is that class of self-similarities? For the hypergeometric series,
 it remains unknown.

For Cantor space, that place where we represent real numbers, the situation
 is much better.
 The Cantor space itself has the structure of an infinite binary tree; the
 tree and it's subtrees are obviously self-similar; the class of similarities
 is described by the dyadic monoid.
 The dyadic monoid embeds naturally into the modular group; this in turn
 is a gateway to vast tracts of modern mathematics.
 The recursive aspects, the shadow that the Cantor space seems to leave
 behind everywhere appears to be

Yet, the picture remains incomplete.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

-transform provides a simple, silly model for multiplying two real numbers
 together: 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra complication
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of taking mod 1 after multiplication just reveals how complex multiplication
 really is.
 After all, mod 1 is just the subtraction of 1; how hard can that be? Moving
 in one direction: the fastest, most efficient-possible algorithm for multiplyin
g two numbers is not known.
 Moving in another direction, the simple iterated maps, shown in figures

 are obviously not only self-similar, but also are surely topologically
 conjugate to one-another, and in all cases are presumably described by
 the dyadic monoid; likewise the Mandelbrot set and it's exterior.
 Yet the details remain obscure.

The meta-question is: what is the correct framework by which one can best
 understand the interplay between symmetries, infinite series, infinite
 recursion and algorithms? Until modern times, mathematical practice has
 reified addition and multiplication into oracular operations that magically
 obtain

the right answer

\end_inset

.
 Modern computers have put a lie to this: the theory of numerical methods
 has made clear that addition and multiplication are necessarily algorithmic
 operations performed on finite truncations of infinite series.
 What other algorithms are hiding nearby, and what is their relationship
 to analytic series?
