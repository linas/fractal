\title{On Differences of Zeta Values}
\author{Philippe Flajolet and Linas Vepstas}

\begin{abstract}
Finite differences of the Riemann zeta function at the integers
are explored. Such quantities, which occur as coefficients in Newton series representations, 
have surfaced in works of Ma{\'s}lanka, Coffey, B{\'a}ez-Duarte, Voros and others.
We apply the theory of N\"orlund-Rice integrals in conjunction with
the saddle point method or the residue theorem and derive precise 
asymptotic estimates. The method extends to Dirichlet $L$-functions,
in which case our estimates appear to be partly related to
earlier investigations surrounding Li's criterion for the Riemann hypothesis.

\section{Introduction}


 


In recent  times, a variety of  authors have, for a variety  of reasons,
been led  to considering   properties  of  representations of   the
Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)=\sum 1/n^s$  as a \emph{Newton interpolation
series}.  Amongst the many  possible  forms, we single out
the one relative to a regularized version of Riemann zeta, namely,
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\zeta(s)-\frac{1}{s-1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty
(-1)^n b_n \binom{s}{n},
\end{equation}
where $\binom{s}{n}$ is a binomial coefficient:
\[
\binom{s}{n}:=\frac{s(s-1)\cdots(s-n+1)}{n!}.
\]
Our results imply that the representation~\eqref{eq1} is
valid thoughout the complex plane,
its coefficients being given by a general   formula   in the calculus  of  finite
differences~\cite{Jordan65,Milne81,Norlund54}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
b_n=
% \sum_{k=0}^n
% \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\left[\zeta(k)-\frac{1}{k-1}\right]
n(1-\gamma-H_{n-1})+\frac12+\sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k}
(-1)^k\zeta(k),
\end{equation}
(Here,
$H_n=1+\frac12+\cdots\frac1n$ are the harmonic numbers.)
Although the terms in the sum defining~$b_n$ become
exponentially large, the values of the $b_n$ are exponentially small,
\[
b_n=\mathcal{O}\left(n^{1/4}e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}\right),
\]
while exhibiting a curious oscillatory behaviour. 
We shall prove (Theorem~\ref{zetacoeff-thm}) that, to the next leading
order,

\begin{equation}\label{asympform}
b_n =2^{3/4}\pi^{-1/4}e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}\cos\left(2\sqrt{\pi n}+\frac{3\pi}{8}\right)n^{1/4}
+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/4} e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}\right).
\end{equation}


A prime reason for  interest in the representation~\eqref{eq1} and the
companion           coefficients~\eqref{eq2}         is     \emph{Li's
criterion}~\cite{Li97} for the   Riemann Hypothesis (RH).   Let $\rho$
range over the  nontrivial zeros of~$\zeta(s)$.   Li's theorem asserts
that RH is true if and only if all members of the sequence
\[
\lambda_n=\sum_\rho \left[1-\left(1-\frac{1}{\rho}\right)\right], \qquad n\ge0,
\]
are nonnegative. (Bombieri and Lagarias
 offer an insightful discussion of Li's criterion in~\cite{BoLa99}.) 
Coffey~\cite{Coffey05} has shown that the $\lambda_n$
can be alternatively  expressed as a  sum of  two terms, one  of which
(the easier one, though) is an elementary variant $\hat b_n$ of $b_n$.
Theorem~2 of~\cite{Coffey05}  amounts to the property that the coefficients $\hat b_n$ 
decrease to~0. As we shall see in a later section, 
the methods originally developed for estimating~$b_n$
yield precise asymptotic information on~$\hat b_n$ as well.

The zeta function has also received attention in physics,
for its role in regularization and renormalization in 
quantum field theory. 
Motivated by such connctions, 
Ma\'slanka introduced in~\cite{Maslanka01} 
what amounts to a Newton series representation of $(1-s)\zeta(s)$.
Further numerical observations relative to the corresponding coefficients
are presented in~\cite{Maslanka04}, which
have been subsequently vindicated by B\'aez-Duarte in~\cite{Baez03}.
In particular, B\'aez-Duarte's estimates imply that the coefficients
in the Newton series of a regularized version of~$(1-s)\zeta(s)$ decrease to~0
faster than any power of $1/n$.

A third independent reason was an attempt by one of us (Linas) around 2003 to obtain
alternative tractable expressions for the Gauss-Kuzmin-Wirsing operator of 
continued fraction theory [unpublished; see
\verb|http://linas.org/math/poch-zeta.pdf|]

In this essay,  we  approach the problem of  asymptotically estimating
differences of  zeta  values by means of   a combination  of  two well
established   techniques.   We   start   from   a   contour   integral
representation of these  differences as defined by~\eqref{eq2}  (for this
technique, see   especially N\"orlund's treatise~\cite{Norlund54}  and
the study~\cite{FlSe95}),  then proceed to estimate the corresponding
complex  integral by  means of the classical  saddle point method of asymptotic
analysis~\cite{deBruijn81,Olver74}. Our approach parallels a recent  preprint
of Voros~\cite{Voros05} (motivated by Li's criterion), 
which our results supplement by providing a fairly 
detailed asymptotic analysis of differences of zeta values.

The next section will review the Newton series for the zeta function,
and give some generating functions for its coefficients. This is followed
by a breif review of some numerical results. The fourth section
gives the N\"orlund integral representation for the series,
while the fifth section provides a careful saddle-point analysis 
of the resulting integrand.  Section seven repeats the analysis
for the Dirichlet $L$-functions, giving the leading asymptotic
term.  We end with a conclusion outlining possible directions
for further research.\footnote{% 
  LV: This paragraph to be modified to fit final form of paper.}



\section{Newton series and zeta values}


This section defines the Newton series for the Riemann zeta
that is to be studied, demonstrates some of its simple properties,
and gives some generating functions for its coefficients.
In this paper, a Newton series will be taken to be defined as

\begin{equation}\label{gennew}
\Phi(s)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n c_n \binom{s}{n}.
\end{equation}
Given a function $\phi(s)$, one may attempt to represent it 
in some region of the complex plane by means of 
such a series. Since the series $\Phi(s)$ terminates at $s=0,1,2,\ldots$,
the conditions $\phi(m)=\Phi(m)$ at the nonnegative integers
imply that the candidate sequence $\{c_n\}$ is linearly related to the
sequence of values $\{\phi(m)\}$ by
\[
\phi(m)=\sum_{n=0}^m (-1)^n c_n \binom{m}{n}.
\]
The triangular system can then be inverted to 
give (by the binomial transform~\cite{GrKnPa89} or by direct elimination)
\begin{equation}\label{gencoeff}
c_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k \phi(k), \qquad n=0,1,2,\ldots\,.
\end{equation}
This choice of coefficients for~\eqref{gennew}
determines the Newton series \emph{associated} to $\phi$.
The coincidence of 
the function $\phi$ and its associated series
$\Phi$ is, by construction, granted at least
at all the nonnegative integers. The equivalence
of $\Phi(m)=\phi(m)$ can be extended to a region
of the complex plane containing the integers, provided that the
growth of the difference $\Phi(s)-\phi(s)$ is bounded in the imaginary
direction. This result is known as \emph{Carlson's theorem}, and is
presented in a more precise form later in this paper.

In the case of the Newton series for $\zeta(s)$, the general
relation~\eqref{gencoeff} provides the coefficients in the form
\begin{equation}\label{bn0}
b_n = s_0-ns_1+\sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k \left[\zeta(k)-\frac{1}{k-1}
\right],
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{bn1}
s_0=\left[\zeta(s)-\frac{1}{s-1}\right]_{s=0}=\frac12,
\qquad
s_1=\lim_{s\to 1} \left[\zeta(s)-\frac{1}{s-1}\right] = \gamma.
\end{equation}
The harmonic numbers appear as
\begin{equation}\label{bn2}
\sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k}\frac{(-1)^k}{k-1}=1-n+nH_{n-1}.
\end{equation}
Equations \eqref{bn0}, \eqref{bn1},   \eqref{bn2} 
then entail that   the
$b_n$, as  defined by~\eqref{eq2}, are indeed the  coefficients  of the Newton series
associated to~$\zeta(s)-1/(s-1)$.

\smallskip

Before engaging in a detailed study of the~$b_n$, we note a few 
simple facts regarding their elementary properties. Set
\begin{equation}\label{deldef}
\delta_n:=\sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k} (-1)^k \zeta(k),
\end{equation}
which are, up to minor adjustments, differences of zeta values at the
integers.  Defining the forward difference $\Delta f(x):=f(x+1)-f(x)$,
one has
\[
\delta_n= (-1)^n \Delta^n Z(x) \bigg|_{x=0},\]
where $Z(k)=\zeta(k)$ for $k\ge2$ and $Z(0)=Z(1)=0$.
Expanding the zeta function according to its definition and 
exchanging the order of summations in the resulting double sum shows that
\begin{equation}\label{simpdel}
\delta_n = \sum_{\ell\ge1} \left[\left(1-\frac{1}{\ell}\right)^n-1+\frac{n}{\ell}\right].
\end{equation}
This rather simple sum shows a remarkably complex behaviour;
elucidating this behaviour is one of the principle topics of this paper.


The ordinary generating function for the sequence $\{\delta_n\}$ 
is also of interest.
Given the classical expansion~\cite{WhWa27} 
of the logarithmic derivative $\psi(z)$ of the Gamma function,
\[
\psi(1+z)+\gamma=\zeta(2)z-\zeta(3)z^2+\zeta(4)z^3-\cdots,
\]
one finds
\begin{equation}\label{delogf}
\sum_{n\ge2}\delta_n z^n =\frac{z}{(1-z)^2}\left[\psi\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right)
+\gamma\right].
\end{equation}
The exponential generating function for the sequence  $\{\delta_n\}$ reflects~\eqref{simpdel} and is even simpler:
% can be directly obtained from~\eqref{simpdel}: 
% multiply by~$z^n/n!$ and sum, to get
\begin{equation}\label{delegf}
\sum_{n\ge2}\delta_n \frac{z^n}{n!}
=e^z\sum_{n\ge2} \zeta(n) \frac{(-z)^n}{n!}=e^z \sum_{\ell\ge1}
\left[e^{-z/\ell}-1+\frac{z}{\ell}\right]
.
\end{equation}
% where the first form results directly from~\eqref{deldef},  the second from~\eqref{simpdel}.


\section{Experimental analysis}

Detailed experiments on the $b_n$ coefficients conducted by one of us are
at the origin of the present paper. As it is usual when dealing with finite differences,
the alternating binomial sums giving the $b_n$ involve exponential
cancellation. We conducted evaluations of the $b_n$ up to $n\approx 5000$,
which requires computing zeta values up to several thousand digits of precision.
(Note that the zeta values can be computed rapidly to extremely high
precision using several efficient algorithms, which are available in several
symbolic computation packages and numerical libraries.)

A quick inspection of numerical data immediately reveals two features
of the constants~$b_n$: they are oscillatory with slowly increasing
period and their
absolute values are very rapidly decreasing. For instance\footnote{%
	The notation $x\doteq y$ designates a numerical approximation of
	$x$ by $y$ to the last decimal digit stated. 
}:
\[\renewcommand{\arraycolsep}{2truept}
\begin{array}{lllllllll}
b_1&\doteq&-	0.07721,\quad &
b_2&\doteq&-	0.00949,\quad &
b_5&\doteq& 	0.00071, \\
b_{10}&\doteq&-	0.00002, \quad &
b_{20}&\doteq& 	2.15965\cdot 10^{-9},\quad &
b_{50}&\doteq&-	1.08802\cdot 10^{-11}.
\end{array}\]

A numeric fit of the oscillatory behaviour of the function may be made.
There are sign changes in the sequence $\{b_n\}$ at
\[
n=3,7,13,21,29,40,52,65,80,97,115,135,157,180,\ldots\,,
\]
the values growing roughly quadratically. A good fit for the $k$th zero is
provided by
\[
q(k)= \frac{\pi}{4}k^2+\frac{9\pi}{16}k+1,\]
rounded at the  nearest integer. (The precise values of the constants were inferred from
values of $n$ well in the range of several thousands.)
The quadratic polynomial is easily 
inverted to give the approximate oscillatory behaviour of the $b_n$:
\[
s(n) = \sin\pi\left(2\sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi}}-\frac{9}{8}\right).\]

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{exper-fig}
Numerical experiments with~$b_n$. Left: a plot of~$\log|b_n/s(n)|$.
Right: a plot of $b_n/\beta(n)$.}
\end{figure}
Once the oscillatory behaviour has been disposed of, the task of quantifying
the general trend in the decrease becomes easier. A plot of the values 
of $\log|b_n/s(n)|$ displayed in Figure~\ref{exper-fig} (left)
has a parabolic aspect, which suggests that
\[
b_n \approx s(n) e^{-K\sqrt{n}} \qquad \hbox{with}\quad K\approx 3.6,\]
but a more precise fit  is strangely difficult. 

In summary, this together with similar experiments led us to conjecture 
\begin{equation}\label{conj}
\beta(n):=  \sin\pi\left(2\sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi}}-\frac{9}{8}\right)  e^{-K\sqrt{n}},
\qquad K=3.6\pm 0.1.
\end{equation}
as  a   rough approximation  to~$b_n$.  Figure~\ref{exper-fig} (right)
displays the ratios $b_n/\beta(n)$  for $n=10\,.\,.\,200$.   The trend  is
compatible furthermore with the presence  of
an   extra   factor   of     the  form   $-n^\kappa$   for   some
$\kappa\in(0,1)$. (The spikes
correspond  to    occasional inaccuracies  of  our sign-change function,    $s(n)$.) 
As we shall see, these empirical observations match reality quite well.


\section{The N\"orlund integral representation}

Our approach to the asymptotic estimation of the $b_n$ relies on
a complex integral representation of finite differences of an analytic function,
to be found in N\"orlund's classic treatise~\cite[\S VIII.5]{Norlund54} first published in 1924.
In computer science, this representation was popularized by Knuth~\cite{Knuth98a},
who attributed it to S.O.~Rice, so that
it also came to be known as ``Rice's method''; see~\cite{FlSe95}
for  a review. 

\begin{lemma} Let $\phi(s)$ be holomorphic in the half-plane 
$\Re(s)\ge n_0-\frac12$. Then the finite differences of the sequence
$(\phi(k))$ admit the integral representation
\[
\sum_{k=n_0}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\phi(k)=\frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}\int_C 
\phi(s) \frac{n!}{s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds,\]
where the contour of integration~$C$ encircles the integers $\{n_0,\ldots,n\}$
in a positive direction and is contained in~$\Re(s)\ge n_0-\frac12$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The verification by residues is immediate.
\end{proof}

An immediate consequence is the following representation for the 
differences of zeta values ($\delta_n$ in~\eqref{deldef}):
\begin{equation}\label{norbn}
\delta_n\equiv \sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\zeta(k)
=-\frac{(-1)^n}{2\pi i}\int_{3/2-i\infty}^{3/2+i\infty} 
\zeta(s) \frac{n!}{s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds. 
\end{equation}
(Start from a small rectangle encircling $\{2,\ldots,n\}$, then 
extend it to a long rectangle with horizontal sides at $\pm i\infty$,
and finally push the right vertical side to $+\infty$.
The contributions relative to 
% the horizontal sizes and the right vertical side 
all but the left vertical side vanish,
since $\zeta(s)$ remains bounded in modulus by~$\zeta(\frac32)$.)

Since~$b_n$ is $\delta_n$ plus a correction term (see Equation~\eqref{eq2}),
the first step is to move the line of integration further to the left.
It is well known that the Riemann zeta function is of finite order in any right half-plane,
that is, $|\zeta(s)|=O(|s|^A)$ uniformly as $|s|\to\infty$, for some~$A$ depending on the
half-plane under consideration~\cite{Titchmarsh86}.
\footnote{
LV: This begs the question "What is A?" We should give values for the left, right plane.
}
As a consequence, the integral of~\eqref{norbn} remains 
convergent, when taken along any vertical line left of~0,
as soon as~$n$ is large enough. Under these conditions, it is possible
to replace the line of integration $\Re(s)=\frac32$ by the line~$\Re(s)=-\frac12$, upon
taking into account the residues of a double pole at $s=1$ and a simple
pole at $s=0$.
We find in this way
\[
\delta_n=(-1)^{n-1} (R_1+R_0)+\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{2\pi i}\int_{-1/2-i\infty}^{-1/2+i\infty} 
\zeta(s) \frac{n!}{s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds, \]
where, as shown by a routine calculation:
\[
(-1)^n R_0=-\frac12,
\qquad
(-1)^nR_1=-n(1-\gamma-H_{n-1}).
\]
The residues thus compensate exactly 
for the difference betwen~$\delta_n$ and~$b_n$ (see~\eqref{eq2}), so that:
\begin{equation}\label{norbn2}
b_n=
\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{2\pi i}\int_{-1/2-i\infty}^{-1/2+i\infty} 
\zeta(s) \frac{n!}{s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds.
\end{equation}

\section{Saddle point analysis of zeta differences}\label{sadzeta-sec}

The integrand in~\eqref{sadzeta-sec} will be seen to be free of 
singularities on the left-hand side, and is thus amenable to evalutation
by the saddle point (or steepest-descent) method.  This evaluation 
is the main topic of this section, and culminates with the derivation of
one of the principle results of this paper, equation~\eqref{asympform}.

It is conventient to perform a change of variables $s\mapsto -s$.
The new integrand involves $\zeta(-s)$, which transforms by virtue of the 
functional equation 
of the zeta function,
\begin{equation}\label{funzeta}
\zeta(1-s)=(2\pi)^{-s}2\cos\left(\frac{s\pi}{2}\right)\Gamma(s)\zeta(s).
\end{equation}
A combination of~\eqref{norbn2} and~\eqref{funzeta} then gives
\begin{equation}\label{mainint}
b_n = -\frac{1}{\pi i} 
\int_{1/2-i\infty}^{1/2+i\infty} 
(2\pi)^{-s-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\zeta(1+s)
\frac{n!\,\Gamma(1+s)}{s(s+1)\cdots(s+n)}\, ds,
\end{equation}
which is the starting point of our asymptotic analysis.

The integral representation~\eqref{mainint} has several noticeable features. 
First, the integrand has no singularity at all in $\Re(s)\ge\frac12$
and it decays fast enough towards $\pm i \infty$,
which means that one can freely choose the abscissa $c$ (with $c\geq\frac12$)
in the representation 
\begin{equation}\label{mainint2}
b_n = -\frac{1}{\pi i} 
\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} 
(2\pi)^{-s-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\zeta(1+s)
\frac{n!\, \Gamma(s+1)}{s(s+1)\cdots(s+n)}\, ds.
\end{equation}
Is is the very absence of singularities calls for an application 
of the saddle  point method.

The factor $\zeta(1+s)$ remains bounded in modulus by a constant,
and is in fact barely distinguishable from~1, as $\Re(s)$ increases,
since
\begin{equation}\label{zetapp}
\zeta(s)=1+\mathcal{O}\left(2^{-\Re(s)}\right), \qquad \Re(s)\ge\frac32.
\end{equation}
Also, for large $|s|$, the complex version of Stirling's formula 
applies:
\begin{equation}\label{stirapp}
\Gamma(1+s) = s^s e^{-s}\sqrt{2\pi s}\left(1+\mathcal{O}(|s|^{-1})\right),\qquad \Re(s)\ge0.
\end{equation}
Finally, the sine factor increases exponentially along vertical lines:
one has
\begin{equation}\label{sinapp}
2i\sin\frac{\pi s}{2} =-\exp\left(-i\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)
+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-\pi \Im(s)/2}\right), \qquad \Im(s)\ge0,
\end{equation}
with a conjugate approximation holding for $\Im(s)<0$.
% (The fact decay at complex infinity of $\Gamma(s)$ then 
% compensates for the growth of the sine factor, so that, ultimately, the integrand 
% decreases polynomially fast, due to the rising factorial in the denominator, roughly
% like $|s|^{-n}$.)

In anticipation of applying saddle-point methods, 
the approximations~\eqref{zetapp}, \eqref{stirapp}, and~\eqref{sinapp}
then suggest the function $e^{\omega(s)}$
 as a simplified model of the integrand in the upper half-plane, where
\begin{equation}\label{omdef}
\omega(s)=-s\log(2\pi)-i\frac{\pi s}{2}+\log\frac{n! \Gamma(s)^2}{\Gamma(s+n)}.
\end{equation}
We'll demonstrate shortly that the location of the saddle 
points on the complex plane will scale as $sqrt{n}$, which may be confirmed 
by numerical experiments. Therefore, in performing an asymptotic analysis,
it is appropriate to perform a change of variable $x=\sqrt(n)$, 
and expand in orders of $n$, presuming $x$ to be approximately constant.
% The asymptotic expansion
% of the $\psi$ function,
% \[
% \psi(s)\equiv \frac{d}{ds}\log\Gamma(s) \sim \log 2-\frac{1}{2s}-\frac{1}{12s}+O(s^{-3}),
% s\to\infty,
% \]
% implies that
We find, uniformly for $x$ in any compact region of $\Re(x)>0$, $\Im(x)>0$:
\begin{equation}\label{om012}
\left\{\begin{array}{lll}
\omega(x\sqrt{n})&=&\ds x\sqrt{n}\left[2\log x-2-\log(2\pi)-\frac12i\pi \right]+\frac12\log n
\\
&&\ds \qquad -\log x +\log(2\pi)-\frac12x^2+\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})
\\
\omega'(x\sqrt{n})&=& \ds \left[-\log(2\pi) -i\frac{\pi}{2}+2\log x\right]
-\left(x+\frac1x\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}).
\\
\omega''(x\sqrt{n})&=&\ds \frac{2}{x\sqrt{n}}+\mathcal{O}(n^{-1}).
\end{array}\right. 
\end{equation}
(The symbolic manipulation system {\sc Maple} is a great help in such computations.)
% Also, at $s=x\sqrt{n}$, one has 
% \begin{equation}\label{om2}
% \begin{array}{lll}
% \log(n!\omega(x\sqrt{n})&=&\ds \sqrt{n}\left[2x\log x-2x-x\log(2\pi)-\frac12i\pi x\right]
% \\
% &=&\ds \quad -\log x -\log\sqrt{n}+\log(2\pi)-\frac12x^2+O(n^{-1/2}).
% \end{array}
% \end{equation}

From the second line of~\eqref{om012}, an approximate root of $\omega'(s)$
is obtained by choosing the particular value~$x_0$ of $x$ that cancels 
$\omega'$ to main asymptotic order:
\begin{equation}\label{x0}
x_0=e^{i\pi/4}\sqrt{2\pi n}.
\end{equation}
This corresponds to the following value for $s$,
\begin{equation}\label{sad0}
\sigma\equiv \sigma(n)= x_0\sqrt{n} = % e^{i\pi/4} \sqrt{2\pi n} =
(1+i)\sqrt{\pi n},
\end{equation}
which is thus also an approximate saddle point for $e^{\omega(s)}$.
The substitution of this value given the first line of~\eqref{om012} then leads to
\begin{equation}\label{appsad}
\exp\left(\omega(\sigma(n))\right)
=\exp\left(2i\sqrt{\pi n}\right) \cdot \exp\left(-2\sqrt{\pi n}\right)\cdot \Pi(n),
\end{equation}
where $\Pi$ is an
unspecified factor of at most polynomial growth. 
By using a suitable contour that passes though~$\sigma(n)$,
we thus expect the quantity in~\eqref{appsad} to be an approximation
(up to polynomial factors again) of~$b_n$. This back-of-the-envelope calculation
does predict  the exponential decay of~$b_n$ as $\exp\left(-3.54490\sqrt{n}\right)$,
in a way consistent with numerical data, while 
the fluctuations,
$
\sin\left(2\sqrt{\pi n}+\mathcal{O}(1)\right),
$
are seen to be in stunning agreement with the empirically obtained formula~\eqref{conj}.

% Equipped with~\eqref{norbn2}, we propose to prove:
% 
% \begin{theorem} The $b_n$ satisfy the asymptotic expansion blabla.

\smallskip
We  must   now fix the   contour  of  integration  and  provide  final
approximations. The   contour  adopted  (Figure~\ref{sad-fig})    goes
through the saddle  point $\sigma=\sigma(n)$ and symmetrically  through
its  complex conjugate $\overline\sigma=\overline{\sigma(n)}$.  In the
upper half-plane, it traverses $\sigma(n)$ along  a line  of steepest
descent   whose   direction, as   determined    from the  argument  of
$\omega''(\sigma)$,  is at an    angle of $\frac{5\pi}{8}$    with the
horizontal  axis.  The contour   also  includes parts of two  vertical
lines of  respective abscissae $\Re(s)=c_1\sqrt{n}$ and~$c_2\sqrt{n}$,
where
\[
0<c_1<\sqrt{\pi}<c_2<2\sqrt{\pi}.
\] 

The  choice of the abscissae, $c_1$  and $c_2$, is
not critical (it is even possible to adapt the analysis to $c_1=c_2=\sqrt{\pi}$).
One verifies  easily, from crude approximations, that
the contributions arising from the vertical parts of the contour are
$\mathcal{O}(e^{-L_0\sqrt{n}})$,    for   some $L_0>2\sqrt{\pi}$,   i.e.,   they  are
exponentially small in the  scale of the problem:
\begin{equation}\label{vert}
\int_{\operatorname{vertical}} = \mathcal{O}\left(e^{-L_0\sqrt{n}}\right)\qquad L_0>2\sqrt{\pi}.
\end{equation}


The slanted part of
the contour is such that all the estimates of~\eqref{om012} apply. 
The scale of the problem is dictated by the value of $\omega''(\sigma)$,
 which is of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$. This indicates that the ``second order'' scaling 
to be adopted is~$n^{1/4}$. Accordingly, we set
\begin{equation}\label{cregion}
s=(1+i)\sqrt{\pi n}+e^{5i\pi/8}yn^{1/4}.
\end{equation}
% Equivalently, we let $x$ vary slightly 
% around $e^{i\pi/4}\sqrt{2\pi}$ by amounts proportional to $n^{-1/4}$.
Define the \emph{central region} of the slanted part of the contour by the condition
that $|y|\le \log^2 n$.
Upon slightly varying the value of~$x$ around~$x_0$, one verifies from~\eqref{om012} that,
for large~$n$, the quantity
\[
\Re\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
\omega\left(x_0\sqrt{n}+e^{5i\pi/8}t\sqrt{n}\right)\right)
\]
is an upward concave function of~$t$ near~$t=0$. There results,
in the complement of the central part, $|y|\ge \log^2n$,
the approximation
\[
\left|\exp\left(\omega\left(x_0\sqrt{n}+e^{5i\pi/8}yn^{1/4}\right)\right)\right|
< e^{\omega(x_0\sqrt{n})}
\cdot \exp\left(-L_1 \log^2 n\right),\qquad L_1>0.
\]
Figuratively:
\begin{equation}\label{cent}
\int_{\operatorname{slanted}}=\int_{\operatorname{central}}+\mathcal{O}\left(\exp\left(-L_1 \log^2 n\right)\right).
\end{equation}
Thus, from~\eqref{vert}  and~\eqref{cent},  only the central   part of the
slanted region matters asymptotically. This applies to $e^{\omega(s)}$ but also
to the full integrand of the representation~\eqref{mainint2} of $b_n$,
given the approximations~\eqref{zetapp}--\eqref{om012}.

\smallskip

We are finally ready to reap the crop. Take the integral representation
of~\eqref{mainint2} with the contour deformed as indicated in Figure~\ref{sad-fig} and
let $b_n^{+}$ be the contribution arising from the upper half-plane, to
the effect that
\begin{equation}\label{conjug}
b_n=2\Re(b_n^+),
\end{equation}
by conjugacy. In the central region, 
\[
s=x_0\sqrt{n}+e^{5i\pi/8}yn^{1/4},
\]
the integrand of~\eqref{mainint2} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{phis}
\left(-\frac{1}{\pi i}\right)\cdot 
(2\pi)^{-1}\cdot 
\left(-\frac{1}{2i}\right)\cdot
 \left(1+\mathcal{O}(2^{-\sqrt{n}})\right)\cdot 
\frac{x_0}{n} \cdot e^{\omega(x_0\sqrt{n})} \cdot
e^{-y^2/\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(1+\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right).
\end{equation}
The various factors found there (compare~\eqref{mainint2} to $e^{\omega(s)}$
with $\omega(s)$ defined in~\eqref{omdef})
are in sequence: the Cauchy integral prefactor; 
the correction $(2\pi)^{-1}$ to the functional equation of Riemann zeta;
the factor $-1/(2i)$ relating the sine to its
exponential approximation; the approximation of Riemann zeta;
the correction $s/(s+n)$ of the Gamma factors; 
the main term $e^{\omega(\sigma)}$;
the anticipated local Gaussian approximation;
the errors resulting from approximations~\eqref{zetapp}--\eqref{om012},
which are of relative order $O(n^{-1/2})$. Upon completing the tails of the 
integral and neglecting exponentially small corrections,
we get
\begin{equation}\label{asy0}
b_n^+ =K_0 e^{\omega(x_0\sqrt{n})}
\frac{x_0}{\sqrt{n}}
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-y^2/\sqrt{2\pi}}\,dy
\cdot\left(e^{5i\pi/8}n^{1/4}\right)\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
where~$K_0$    is the contant  factor  of~\eqref{phis}, while the factor
following   the integral   translates the   change   of   variables:
$ds=e^{5i\pi/8}n^{1/4}dy$. 

The  asymptotic form of~$b_n$ is now completely
determined by~\eqref{conjug} and~\eqref{asy0}.
We have obtained:

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\Img{7}{comparapp.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{comparapp-fig} A comparative plot of $b_n$ and 
the main term of its approximation~\eqref{thmz},
both multiplied by $e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}n^{-1/4}$, for $n=5\,.\,.\,500$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem} \label{zetacoeff-thm}
The Newton coefficient $b_n$ of $\zeta(s)-1/(s-1)$ defined in~\eqref{eq2}
satisfies:
\begin{equation}\label{thmz}
b_n = \left( \frac{8n}{\pi}\right)^{1/4}
e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}\cos\left(2\sqrt{\pi n}+\frac{3\pi}{8}\right)
+\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-2\sqrt{\pi n}}n^{-1/4}\right).
% \qquad
% K:=2^{3/4}\pi^{-1/4}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

The agreement between asymptotic and exact values is quite good,
even for small values of~$n$ (Figure~\ref{comparapp-fig}).

\smallskip

The foregoing developments justify a posteriori the application of the saddle point formula to the N\"orlund Rice
integral representation~\eqref{mainint2} of zeta value differences. This formula
reads
\begin{equation}\label{sadfor}
\int e^{-Nf(x)} \, dx =\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{N|f''(x_0)|}}
e^{-N f(x_0)}\left(1+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\right).
\end{equation}
Here the analytic function $f(x)$ should be such that $|f(x)|$ has a saddle-point at~$x_0$,
that is, $f'(x_0)=0$ and $f''(x_0)$ is the second derivative of~$f$ at the saddle point.
In the case of differences of zeta values, 
the appropriate scaling parameter is $s=x\sqrt{n}$ corresponding to $N=\sqrt{n}$, and the
the function~$f$ is
\[
f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\omega\left(x\sqrt{n}\right),
\]
up to smaller order corrections that can be treated as constants in the range of the saddle point.

\section{Convergence of the Newton series of zeta}

The fact that the coefficients $b_n$ decay to zero faster than any polynomial in~$1/n$ 
implies that the Newton series
\begin{equation}\label{newtonz}
\Phi(s)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n b_n \binom{s}{n},
\end{equation}
with $b_n$ given by~\eqref{eq2},
converges throughout the complex plane, and consequently defines an entire function.
Set $Z(s):=\zeta(s)-1/(s-1)$ with~$Z(1)=\gamma$. We have, by construction $\Phi(s)=Z(s)$
at $s=0,1,2\ldots\,$, but the relation between $\Phi$ and $Z$ at other points is still unclear.

\begin{corollary}\label{newton-cor} The Newton series of~\eqref{newtonz} 
is a convergent representation of the function $\zeta(s)-1/(s-1)$
at all points $s\in\C$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof} 
Here  is our favorite  proof.  A   classic theorem  of Carlson  (for a
discussion        and      a     proof,     see,      e.g.,    Hardy's
Lectures~\cite[pp.~188-191]{Hardy78}          or          Titchmarsh's
treatise~\cite[\S5.81]{Titchmarsh39})  says the following:
\emph{Assume that $(i)$~$g(s)$ is
analytic and such that
\[
\left|g(s)\right|<C^{A|s|},
\]
where $A<\pi$, in the right half-plane of complex values of~$s$,
and $(ii)$~$g(0)=g(1)=\ldots=0$. Then $g(s)$ vanishes identically.}


To complete the proof, it  suffices to apply  Carlson's theorem to the
difference    $g(s)=\Phi(s+2)-Z(s+2)$.
Condition~$(ii)$ is    satisfied  by   construction  of    the  Newton
series. Condition~$(i)$ results from  the fact that $Z(s+2)$ is $\mathcal{O}(1)$
while  a general bound  on Newton series
(Equation~(58) of~\cite[p.~228]{Norlund54})
implies
% \footnote{This way of proceeding is not very satifactory!}  
that $|\Phi(s+2)|$  is of 
growth at most $e^{\frac{\pi}{2}|s|}$, throughout $\Re(s)>-\frac12$.
% I struggled quite a bit to find a direct elementary proof instead.
% Please don't discard what follows for the moment!
% 
% Regarding the promised crude bounds,
% use $f(x)\ll g(x)$ to express that $f(x)\le M g(x)$ for some absolute constant~$M$. We have,
% with $S=|s|$:
% \[
% \begin{array}{lll}
% |\Phi(s)|& \ll & \ds \sum_{n\ge0}e^{-\sqrt{n}}
% \left|\binom}{s}{n}\right| \ll 
% \left(\sum_{0\le n \le 2S}\binom{S+n-1}{n}\right)+
% \left(\sum_{2S<n} e^{-\sqrt{n}}
% \left|\binom}{s}{n}\right|\right) \\
% &\ll& \ds e^{2S}+\sum_{2S<n} e^{-\sqrt{n}}
% \left|\binom}{s}{n}\right|.
% \end{array}
% \]
% Next, for $\Re(s)>0$ and $n>2|s|$, simple geometry shows that
% \[
% \left|\binom}{s}{n}\right| \le \left|\binom}{in/2}{n}\right|
% 
% 
% \binom{S+n-1}{n}\ll\sum_{n\ge0}e^{-\sqrt{n}}\frac{(S+n)^n}{n!}
% \ll \sum_{n\ge0}e^{-\sqrt{n}}\frac{n^n}{n!}\left(1+\frac{S}{n}\right)^n\\
% &\ds \ll& e^{n\log(1+S/n)}\ll e^S.
% \end{array}
% \]
\end{proof}

An alternative proof can be given starting from a contour integral representation for the remainder of 
a general Newton series given~\cite[p.~223]{Norlund54}. In a short note, B\'aez-Duarte~\cite{Baez03}
justified a similar looking Newton series representation of the zeta function due to Ma\'slanka---however
his bounds on the Newton coefficients are less precise than ours and his arguments (based on
a doubly indexed sequence of polynomials) seem to be somewhat problem-specific.




\section{Dirichlet $L$-functions}

This section defines the Dirichlet $L$-functions, and sets up 
the asymptotic analysis of thier Newton series. The development
parallels the anaylysis performed for the Riemann zeta, and so
is given in abbreviated form. The results are similar in nature,
and indeed, the result for the Riemann zeta can be retreived as 
a special case.  Thus, an effort will be made to focus on how these
sums differ.

The Dirichlet $L$-functions\cite{Apostol76,Davenport80} are defined
in terms of the Dirichlet characters, which are group representation
characters of the cyclic group. 
% They play an important role in number
% theory, and the Riemann hypothesis generalizes to the \emph{L}-functions.
The Dirichlet characters are multiplicative functions, and are periodic
modulo $k$. That is, a character $\chi(n)$ is an arithmetic function
of an integer $n$, with period $k$, such that $\chi(n+k)=\chi(n)$.
A character is multiplicative, in that $\chi(mn)=\chi(m)\chi(n)$
for all integers $m,n$. Furthermore, one has that $\chi(1)=1$ and
$\chi(n)=0$ whenever $\gcd(n,k)\ne1$. The \emph{L}-function associated
with the character $\chi$ is defined as \begin{equation}
L(\chi,s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\chi(n)}{n^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 All such \emph{L}-functions may be re-expressed in terms of the Hurwitz
zeta function as
\begin{equation}
L(\chi,s)=\frac{1}{k^{s}}\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)\zeta\left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)\label{eq:L-Hurwitz}\end{equation}
 where $k$ is the period of $\chi$ and $\zeta(s,q)$ is the Hurwitz
zeta function, given by \begin{equation}
\zeta(s,q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+q)^{s}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 Thus, the study of the analytic properties of the \emph{L}-functions
can be partially unified through the study of the Hurwitz zeta function.


% \section{Forward differences}

In analogy to the forward differences of the Riemann
zeta function, the coefficients of the Newton series 
are given by
\begin{equation}
L_{n}=\sum_{p=2}^{n}(-1)^{p}
\binom{n}{p}
L(\chi,p)\label{eq:L-coeff}\end{equation}
 Because of the relation~\eqref{eq:L-Hurwitz} connecting the Hurwitz
zeta function to the L-function, it is sufficient to study sums of
the form
\begin{equation}
A_{n}(m,k)=\sum_{p=2}^{n}(-1)^{p}\
\binom{n}{p}
\frac{\zeta\left(p,\frac{m}{k}\right)}{k^{p}}
\end{equation}
 since 
\begin{equation}
L_{n}=\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)\, A_{n}(m,k)
\end{equation}

 Converting the sum to the N\"orlund-Rice integral, and extending the
contour to the half-circle at positive infinity, and noting that the
half-circle does not contribute to the integral, one obtains 
\begin{equation}
A_{n}(m,k)=\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2\pi i}\, n!\,
\int_{\frac{3}{2}-i\infty}^{\frac{3}{2}+i\infty}
\frac{\zeta\left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)}{k^{s}s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds
\end{equation}
 Moving the contour to the left, one encounters single pole at $s=0$
and a double pole at $s=1$. The residue of the pole at $s=0$ is
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Res}(s=0)=\zeta\left(0,\frac{m}{k}\right)
\end{equation}
 where one has the curious identity in the form of a multiplication
theorem for the digamma function:
\begin{equation}
\zeta\left(0,\frac{m}{k}\right)
=\frac{-1}{\pi k}\sum_{p=1}^{k}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right)
\psi\left(\frac{p}{k}\right)
=-B_{1}\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)
=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{m}{k}
\end{equation}
 Here, $\psi$ is the digamma function and $B_{1}$is the Bernoulli
polynomial of order 1. The double pole at $s=1$ evaluates to
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Res}(s=1)=\frac{n}{k}
\left[\psi\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)+\ln k+1-H_{n-1}\right]
\end{equation}
 Combining these, one obtains 
\begin{equation}
A_{n}(m,k)=\left(\frac{m}{k}-\frac{1}{2}\right)
-\frac{n}{k}\left[\psi\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)+\ln k+1-H_{n-1}\right]
+a_{n}(m,k)
\end{equation}
The previous results for the Riemann zeta may be regained by setting 
$m=k=1$, so that $\delta_n=A_n(1,1)$ and $b_n=a_n(1,1)$.  As before,
the $a_n(m,k)$ have the remarkable property of being exponentially
small; that is, 
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(m,k)=\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-\sqrt{Kn}}\right)
\end{equation}
 for a constant $K$ of order $m/k$. The next section develops an
explicit asymptotic form for this term.

\section{Saddle-point analysis of $L$-function differences}
The behvaiour of the exponentially small term may be obtained 
by using the same saddle-point analysis given in the previous
sections. Again, its application here is abbreviated, as there
are no substantial differences in the course of the derivations.

The term $a_{n}(m,k)$ is represented by the integral
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(m,k)=\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2\pi i}\, n!\,
\int_{-\frac{1}{2}-i\infty}^{-\frac{1}{2}+i\infty}
\frac{\zeta\left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)}{k^{s}s(s-1)\cdots(s-n)}\, ds
\label{eq:little-a-integral}\end{equation}

 which resulted from shifting the integration contour past the poles.
At this point, the functional equation for the Hurwitz zeta may be
applied. This equation is 
\begin{equation}
\zeta\left(1-s,\frac{m}{k}\right)
=\frac{2\Gamma(s)}{(2\pi k)^{s}}
\sum_{p=1}^{k}\cos\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}-\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right)
\zeta\left(s,\frac{p}{k}\right)
\end{equation}
 This allows the integral to be expressed as
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(m,k)=-\frac{2n!}{k\pi i}\sum_{p=1}^{k}
\int_{\frac{3}{2}-i\infty}^{\frac{3}{2}+i\infty}
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{s}}\frac{\Gamma(s)\Gamma(s-1)}{\Gamma(s+n)}
\cos\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}-\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right)
\zeta\left(s,\frac{p}{k}\right)\, ds
\end{equation}
 It will prove to be convenient to pull the phase factor out of the
cosine part; we do this now, and write this integral as 
\begin{eqnarray}
a_{n}(m,k) & = & -\frac{n!}{k\pi i}
\sum_{p=1}^{k}\exp\left(i\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right) \\
 & & \qquad 
\int_{\frac{3}{2}-i\infty}^{\frac{3}{2}+i\infty}
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{s}}\frac{\Gamma(s)\Gamma(s-1)}{\Gamma(s+n)}\,
\exp\left(-i\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)
\zeta\left(s,\frac{p}{k}\right)\, ds
\label{eq:two-integrals}\\
 &  & \qquad \qquad +c.c.\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
 where $c.c.$ means that $i$ should be replaced by $-i$ in the
two exp parts.

For large values of $n$, this integral may be evaluated by means
of the saddle-point method, just like in the case of
differences of the Riemann zeta function.
%  The saddle-point method, or method of
% steepest descents, may be applied whenever the integrand can be approximated
% by a sharply peaked Gaussian, as the above can be for large $n$.
% More precisely, The saddle-point theorem states that \begin{equation}
% \int e^{-Nf(x)}dx\approx\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{N\left|f^{\,\prime\prime}(x_{0})\right|}}e^{-Nf(x_{0})}\left[1-\frac{f^{(4)}(x_{0})}{8N\left|f^{\,\prime\prime}(x_{0})\right|^{2}}+\cdots\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}
%  is an asymptotic expansion for large $N$. Here, the function $f$
% is taken to have a local minimum at $x=x_{0}$ and $f^{\,\prime\prime}(x_{0})$
% and $f^{(4)}(x_{0})$ are the second and fourth derivatives at the
% local minimum. 
% 
In what follows, we dispense with analytic details---these would
closely mimick what was done in Section~\ref{sadzeta-sec}---and directly proceed  
from the saddle point formula~\eqref{sadfor}.


To recast the equation~\eqref{eq:two-integrals} into the form needed
for the saddle point method, an asymptotic expansion of the
integrands needs to be made for large $n$. 
% After such an expansion,
% it is seen that the saddle point occurs at large values of $s$, and
% so an asymptotic expansion in large $s$ is warranted as well. 
% As
% it is confusing and laborious to simultaneously expand in two parameters,
% it is better to seek out an order parameter to couple the two. This
% may be done as follows. 
% One notes that 
% the integrands have a minimum,
% on the real $s$ axis, near $s=\sigma_{0}=\sqrt{\pi kn/p}$ and so
As before, the appropriate scaling parameter is $x=s/\sqrt{n}$,
and so one may perform a change of variable from $s$ to $x$. The asymptotic
expansion is then performed by holding $x$ constant, and taking $n$
large. Thus, one writes 
\begin{eqnarray}
a_{n}(m,k) & = & -\frac{1}{k\pi i}\sum_{p=1}^{k}
\left[\exp\left(i\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right)
\int_{\sigma_{0}-i\infty}^{\sigma_{0}+i\infty}e^{\omega(x\sqrt{n})}dx\right.
\label{eq:saddle}\\
 &  & \qquad \qquad \left.+\exp\left(-i\frac{2\pi pm}{k}\right)
\int_{\sigma_{0}-i\infty}^{\sigma_{0}+i\infty}
e^{\overline{\omega}(x\sqrt{n})}dx\right]
\end{eqnarray}
 where $\overline{\omega}$ is the complex conjugate of $\omega$. 

Proceeding, one has 
\begin{equation}
\omega(s)=\log n!+\frac{1}{2}\log n
-s\log\left(\frac{2\pi p}{k}\right)-i\frac{\pi s}{2}
+\log\frac{\Gamma(s)\Gamma(s-1)}{\Gamma(s+n)}
+\mathcal{O}\left( \left(\frac{p}{k+p}\right)^s \right)
\end{equation}
 where the approximation that 
$\log \zeta\left(s,p/k\right)=(k/p)^{s}+\mathcal{O}\left( (p/(k+p))^s \right)$
for large $s$ has been made. 

% We don't use this!
% More generally, one has \begin{equation}
% \log\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\;\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}\log n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
%  where $\Lambda(n)$ is the Mangoldt function. (XXX What about Hurwitz?)
The asymptotic expansion for the Gamma function is given by the Stirling
expansion~\eqref{stirapp}.
% Do we need Bernoulli numbers??
% \begin{equation}
% \log\Gamma(x)=\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\log x-x+\frac{1}{2}\log2\pi+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{B_{2j}}{2j(2j-1)x^{2j-1}}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
% and $B_{k}$ are the Bernoulli numbers. 
Expanding to $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$
and collecting terms, one obtains 

\begin{eqnarray}
\omega(x\sqrt{n}) & = & \frac{1}{2}\log n
-x\sqrt{n}\left[\log\frac{2\pi p}{k}+i\frac{\pi}{2}+2-2\log x\right] \\
 &  & +\log2\pi-2\log x-\frac{x^{2}}{2} \\
 &  & +\frac{1}{6x\sqrt{n}}\left[10+x^{2}\right]
+\frac{1}{2n}\left[1-\frac{x^{2}}{2}-\frac{x^{4}}{6}
+\frac{73}{72x^{2}}\right]
+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-3/2}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

\footnote{
 LV: After subsitution of p=k=1 in this forumla, one of the log x 
terms differs by a factor of two from that in equation \eqref{om012}. 
This should be resolved.
}
 The saddle point may be obtained  by solving $\omega'(x\sqrt{n})=0$.  To
 lowest order, one  obtains $x_{0}=(1+i)\sqrt{\pi  p/k}$. To  use  the
 saddle-point  formula,  one needs
 $\omega''(x\sqrt{n})=2/x\sqrt{n}+\mathcal{O}(n^{-1})$.
 Substituting, one directly obtains 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\sigma_{0}-i\infty}^{\sigma_{0}+i\infty}
e^{\omega(x\sqrt{n})}dx 
=\left(\frac{2\pi^{3}pn}{k}\right)^{1/4}e^{i\pi/8}
\exp\left(-(1+i)\sqrt{\frac{4\pi pn}{k}}\right)
+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/4}e^{-2\sqrt{\pi pn/k}\right)
\end{equation}
 while the integral for $\overline{\omega}$ is the complex conjugate of
this (having a saddle point at the complex conjugate location). Inserting
this into equation \ref{eq:saddle} gives 
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(m,k)=\frac{1}{k}
\sum_{p=1}^{k}\left(\frac{2np}{\pi k}\right)^{1/4}
\exp\left(-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi pn}{k}}\right)
\cos\left(\frac{2\pi pm}{k}+\frac{5\pi}{8}-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi pn}{k}}\right)
+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/4}e^{-2\sqrt{\pi pn/k}\right)
\label{eq:an-p}\end{equation}
For large $n$, only the $p=1$ term contributes significantly, and
so one may write
\begin{equation}
a_{n}(m,k)=\frac{1}{k}\left(\frac{2n}{\pi k}\right)^{1/4}
\exp\left(-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi n}{k}}\right)
\cos\left(\frac{2\pi m}{k}+\frac{5\pi}{8}-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi n}{k}}\right)
+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/4}e^{-2\sqrt{\pi pn/k}\right)
\end{equation}
 which demonstrates the desired result: the terms $a_{n}$ are exponentially
small.

 LV: At this time, subsituting p=k=1 into the above yeilds a formula 
that differs by overall magnitude of sqrt(2) and also differs by a 
phase of $\pi/4$ as compared to equation \eqref{thmz}.  I'm double-cheking

% \section{More L-functions}

We conclude by briefly returning to the structure of the Dirichlet
L-functions. The L-function coefficients defined in equation \ref{eq:L-coeff}
are now given by \begin{equation}
L_{n}=\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)A_{n}(m,k)\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 Writing \begin{equation}
A_{n}=B_{n}+a_{n}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 so that $B_{n}(m,k)$represents the non-exponential part, one may
state a few results. For the non-principal characters, one has $\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)=0$
and thus, the first term simplifies to \begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)B_{n}(m,k)=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)\left[\frac{m}{n}-\psi\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 For the principal character $\chi_{1}$, one has $\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi_{1}(m)=\varphi(k)$
with $\varphi(k)$ the Euler totient function. Thus, for the principal
character, one obtains \begin{equation}
\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi_{1}(m)B_{n}(m,k)=-\varphi(k)\left[\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{k}\left(\ln k+1-H_{n-1}\right)\right]+\frac{1}{k}\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)\left[\frac{m}{n}-\psi\left(\frac{m}{k}\right)\right]\label{eq:}\end{equation}


By contrast, the exponentially small term invokes a linear combination
of Gauss sums. The Gauss sum associated with a character $\chi$is
\begin{equation}
G(n,\chi)=\sum_{m\mbox{ mod}k}\chi(m)e^{2\pi imn/k}\label{eq:}\end{equation}
 and so, to leading order \begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{m=1}^{k}\chi(m)a_{n}(m,k) & \approx & \frac{1}{2ik}\left(\frac{2}{\pi kn^{3}}\right)^{1/4}\exp\left(-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi n}{k}}\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & \left[\exp i\left(\frac{\pi}{8}-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi n}{k}}\right)G(1,\chi)-\exp-i\left(\frac{\pi}{8}-\sqrt{\frac{4\pi n}{k}}\right)G(-1,\chi)\right]\label{eq:}\end{eqnarray}
 The higher-order terms with $p>1$ dropped from equation \ref{eq:an-p}
correspond to terms involving $G(p,\chi)$.

TODO -- The Hurwitz zeta can be avoided entirely by working directly
with the functional equation for the L-functions, as given by Apostol,
Chapter 12, Theorem 12.11. The direct form seems to imply some sort
of result/constraint on the $p\ne1$ terms in the expansion. It also
suggests that most of the deriviation above could be made clearer
by assuming a generic functional equation, and stating results in
terms of that. (e.g. assume Selberg-class type functional equation).

\smallskip
The previous results\footnote{%
	PF: We need a theorem statement summarizing both the principal and nonprincipal
	characters.}
unify and make precise a number of estimates carried out in the literature by a diversity
of methods. For instance, the study of quantities arising in connection with Li's criterion
calls for estimating
\begin{equation}\label{coffeyS1}
\overline{b}_n=\sum_{k=2}^n \binom{n}{k}(-1)^k(1-2^{-k})\zeta(k).
\end{equation}
Coffey encountered this quantity (his~$S_1(n)$ in~\cite{Coffey05}),
and proved, by means of series rearrangements akin to~\eqref{simpdel}
used in conjunction with Euler-Maclaurin summation:
\begin{equation}\label{coffeyineq}
S_1(n)\ge \frac{n}{2}\log n+(\gamma-1)\frac{n}{2}+\frac12.
\end{equation}
Our analysis quantifies  the difference between the two quantities above as
being exponentially small and oscillating.

Another observation is that the combination of N\"orlund-Rice integrals
and saddle point estimates applies to many ``desingularized'' versions of 
the Riemann zeta function: they apply equally well to
the case of~$(1-2^{1-s})\zeta(s)$ corresponding to~\eqref{coffeyS1} above
and to functions like
\[
(s-1)\zeta(s), \quad
\zeta(2s)-\frac{1}{2s-1},\quad
(2s-1)\zeta(2s),
\]
and so on. The 
Newton series involving $\zeta(2s)$ include Ma{\'s}lanka's expansion~\cite{Maslanka01}, which is
relative to $(2s-1)\zeta(2s)$.
They have a striking feature---their coefficients are, up to a gamma factor,
polynomials in~$\pi$ with rational coefficients. 
For a function like $\zeta(2s)-1/(2s-1)$ where the polar part is subtracted,
the exponential smallness of the coefficients
then has the peculiar feature of providing near identities that relate $\pi$ and
Euler's constant~$\gamma$.
