So here's the idea:

flip a coin (Bernoulli process) with 50-50 and the ergodic process is a
uniform distribution on a unit interval. i.e. that's the invariant measure
of the frobenius-perron operator of the bernoulli process.

flip a coin, and treat each flip result as a move-left/right. This is
the Brownian walk, limiting to the Gaussian.

Implemented so far: bsic framework random-walk.c for gaussian

TODO: repeat, for the beta xform. We're walking, but where are we
walking to?  Yes, there's now a constant velocity. Subtract that
constant velocity, and where do we go? Is this something trivial, or
something complicated?
