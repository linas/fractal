directories:

../generate: pre 2010
   -- All the 2D work prior to the 2010 refactoring is in this
      directory, including the fractals, the ordinary generating
      functions of the number-theoretic functions, etc.

num-theory: 2005-2007
   -- Graphs of slices of ord. generating functions of number-theoretic
      functions, with an attempt to find minkowski-like behavior.

calkin-wilf: Sept 2015
   -- A recursive function that gives the denominator of the
      Stern-Brocot tree. Graphing it, its reminiscent of Minkowski
      measure.

graph:
   -- Schroedinger eqn on a 1D lattice

geodesic:
   -- Explores the symbol dynamics of the SL(2,Z) fundamental domain.

measure: Sept 2015
   -- (exact) approximation and bound for the Minkowski measure,
      inclusing scaling of the thing.

norlund-rice:
	-- Graphs plot of Riemann zeta, and numeric show of one of
	   Baez-Duarte's Riemann sums. Minor stuff

plouffe:
  -- Checks a series of Riemann zeta identities for some of
     Plouffe's sums.

schroedinger:
   -- Solving misc 1-d schroedinger equations.

ffbasis: Dec 2014
   -- Falling factorial basis for divisor/multiplicative functions

gpf: April, Oct 2016

arithmexpic: Oct 2016
   -- Exponential generating function for the number-theoretic
      functions.

logpf: June 2017
   -- Continuing in the vein of GPF, arithmexpic, but for logarithms.

snake: Nov 2017
   -- Look at the pseudo-arc as defined by WAYNE LEWIS AND PIOTR MINC
      DRAWING THE PSEUDO-ARC  Very little done here.

circle: Dec 2017
   -- Recreate some of the old circle-map stuff. Add in simplifications.

beta-xform: Dec 2017
   -- Look at simplifications of Bernoulli map. Look at the Beta
      Transform.

borel-mink: Feb 2018
   -- Look a the Borel transform of the Minkowski fn.

mobexpic: Jan 2019
   -- Like arithmexpic, but a deeper look into Mobius and iterated units.

redheffer: Jan 2019
   -- The Redheffer operator, which has any/every completely
      multiplicative series as an eigenvector.

yarh-two: Feb 2019
   -- Another Riemann Hypothesis about multiplicative series.

scatter: July 2019
   -- generic scatterplot tool
