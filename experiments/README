gpf: April, Oct 2016
   -- Greatest Prime factor, exponential generating function.

arithmexpic: Oct 2016
   -- Exponential generating function for the number-theoretic
      functions. Vast numbers of very pretty pictures.

logpf: 30 June 2017
   -- Continuing in the vein of GPF, arithmexpic, but for logarithms.

snake: 27 Nov 2017
   -- Look at the pseudo-arc as defined by WAYNE LEWIS AND PIOTR MINC
      DRAWING THE PSEUDO-ARC  Very little done here.

circle: 4 Dec 2017
   -- Recreate some of the old circle-map stuff. Add in simplifications.
      Lots of very pretty images!

beta-xform: Dec 2017 through 2020
   -- Look at simplifications of Bernoulli map. Look at the Beta
      Transform. Lots and lots of pretty pictures!
      The Beta Transform is the iterated eqn (bx mod 1) for
      for 1<b<2. See the README for details.

adammaj1: Dec 2017
   -- code from Adam Majewski which he wanted me to look at & fix.

borel-mink: 31 January 2018
   -- Look at the Borel transform of the Minkowski fn.
      Also the Riesz–Herglotz transform.

mobexpic: 17 January 2019
   -- Like arithmexpic, but a deeper look into Mobius and iterated units.

redheffer: 9 February 2019
   -- The Redheffer operator, which has any/every completely
      multiplicative series as an eigenvector.

yarh-two: Feb 2019
   -- Another Riemann Hypothesis about multiplicative series.

scatter: 11 July 2019
   -- generic scatterplot tool

dynamical-zeta: 10 Sept 2020
   -- The dynamical zeta sum_n n^-s exp (2pi ix_n) for sequences x_n.

odometer: 13 September 2020
   -- Bernoulli and Ornstein odometers

beta-expand: September-October 2020
   -- Beta expansions. Described in the paper beta-expand.lyx.
      The Beta Transform is the iterated eqn (bx mod 1) for
      for 1<b<2. See the README for details.

polylog: October 2023
   -- See also hurwitz, above, where the old main polylog work happened.
      This directory contains all the scripting and new work,
      used to make more polylog movies.

circle-metric: November 2023
   -- Revisit the old circle-map stuff. Extend, expand, look at more
      things. Originally meant to explore the idea of series metrics,
      but blew up into a more general exploration.

markov: December 2023
   -- Markov numbers

The End.

That's all, folks!
