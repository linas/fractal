   -- Extensive exploration of continued fractions, Takagi curve,

      This is where I slowly come to realize that the symmetries of
      assorted dyadic fractals, continued fractions, binary trees, etc.
      are the symmetries of SL(2,Z) the modular group, or rather, the
      modular monoid. So the source code does not yet call it that,
      because I hadn't yet made that realization.
