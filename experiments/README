../generate: pre 2010
   -- All the 2D work prior to the 2010 refactoring is in this
      directory, including the fractals, the ordinary generating
      functions of the number-theoretic functions, etc.

symbolic: 17 Jan 2005
   -- Hacky code to compute metric tensors, Christoffel symbols,
      Ricci tensor, Scalar curvature. Written because I'm too
      lazy to learn real computer algebra systems.

surface: 12 Jun 2005
   -- Graphs of the lengths and energies of geodesics on the Riemann
      surface/fundamental domain.

weyl: 14 July 2005
   -- Weyl group functions hack

wavelet: 3 January 2006
   -- matrix elements of the transfer operator (composition operator)
      of the Minkowski question mark function. The basis are Haar wavelets.

num-theory: 2005-2007
   -- Graphs of slices of ord. generating functions of number-theoretic
      functions, with an attempt to find minkowski-like behavior.

zipf: 15 March 2009
   -- Experiments with random strings

walsh: July 2009
   -- Walsh functions provide a basis for square-integrable functions.
      The 'prime factors' of the walsh functions are the Rademacher functions.
      Derivative of minkowski-question-mark, integrated with
      the Walsh functions
      Fractal eigenfunctions of GKW. (Jan 2016)

synthetic: Nov 2010
   -- Some intractable sum over Riemann zeta. Dead end.

yarh: Dec 2010
   -- "Yet Another Riemann Hypothesis", Looks at zeros in the critical
      strip obtained by integrating permutations of continued fractions.
      Inspired by noticing that Riemann zeta is integral of truncated
      continued fraction.

calkin-wilf: Sept 2015
   -- A recursive function that gives the denominator of the
      Stern-Brocot tree. Graphing it, its reminiscent of Minkowski
      measure.

graph:
   -- Schroedinger eqn on a 1D lattice

geodesic:
   -- Explores the symbol dynamics of the SL(2,Z) fundamental domain.

measure: Sept 2015
   -- (exact) approximation and bound for the Minkowski measure,
      inclusing scaling of the thing.

norlund-rice:
	-- Graphs plot of Riemann zeta, and numeric show of one of
	   Baez-Duarte's Riemann sums. Minor stuff

plouffe:
  -- Checks a series of Riemann zeta identities for some of
     Plouffe's sums.

schroedinger:
   -- Solving misc 1-d schroedinger equations.

ffbasis: Dec 2014
   -- Falling factorial basis for divisor/multiplicative functions

gpf: April, Oct 2016
   -- Greatest Prime factor, exponential generating function.

arithmexpic: Oct 2016
   -- Exponential generating function for the number-theoretic
      functions.

logpf: June 2017
   -- Continuing in the vein of GPF, arithmexpic, but for logarithms.

snake: Nov 2017
   -- Look at the pseudo-arc as defined by WAYNE LEWIS AND PIOTR MINC
      DRAWING THE PSEUDO-ARC  Very little done here.

circle: Dec 2017
   -- Recreate some of the old circle-map stuff. Add in simplifications.

beta-xform: Dec 2017
   -- Look at simplifications of Bernoulli map. Look at the Beta
      Transform.

adammaj1: Dec 2017
   -- code from Adam Majewski which he wanted me to look at & fix.

borel-mink: Feb 2018
   -- Look a the Borel transform of the Minkowski fn.

mobexpic: Jan 2019
   -- Like arithmexpic, but a deeper look into Mobius and iterated units.

redheffer: Jan 2019
   -- The Redheffer operator, which has any/every completely
      multiplicative series as an eigenvector.

yarh-two: Feb 2019
   -- Another Riemann Hypothesis about multiplicative series.

scatter: July 2019
   -- generic scatterplot tool

dynamical-zeta: Sept 2020
